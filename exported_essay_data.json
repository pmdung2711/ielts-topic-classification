Nowadays new technology is increasingly being used to teach students.", "extra_topic": "What are the advantages and disadvantages of this new approach in teaching?", "model_answer": "We have moved into a technology-driven era where technology is affecting many different aspects of our life, and education is no exception. So, in some schools, traditional methods of education have been revolutionised by new technology to the extent that the lecture is no longer the main method of teaching students. While this new approach has some advantages, it also has many significant shortcomings. This essay outlines both the advantages of disadvantages of this novel approach.\n\nPerceivably the biggest advantage of the use of the latest technology in education is the flexibility it offers. This is evident in two different ways-  firstly, it is now no longer essential for students to be present in the classroom for their courses. Covid-19 pandemic has specifically taught us how this flexibility could be a lifesaver. Moreover, the distance learning facility enables employed professionals, housewives and people from different countries to enrol and successfully finish useful courses offered by numerous institutes. Another area of flexibility is of course that the lecturers can use interactive tools like \"Moodles\" and other tools to deliver their courses in a more stimulating way to large numbers of students.\n\nNot everything, however, about the introduction of this new technology into education is useful. To start, not all students are comfortable with using technology, even if they are part of the digital native generation. This is a grave issue as they may suffer from their lack of technological skills and interests. For instance, an overwhelming number of students, almost 75%, despite their enthusiasm about smartphones and computers, reported that they do not like online classes. Another related issue is that education is a human activity and it works best with as much human interaction as possible. Impersonal technology cannot replace the human contact found in traditional face-to-face tutorials and seminars. Thus a piece of technology or tool can never be an alternative to experts tutors who know their students individually and act accordingly.\n\nTo conclude, technology in education brings some important benefits and enables distance learning possible. It also becomes the only way of learning and teaching during pandemics and disasters. However, by the fact that it can be too impersonal for some and discourages others for their lack of technological skills or passion, it is still not the best method to teach and learn.\n\n[Written and submitted by - Adriana]", "original_link": "https://www.ielts-mentor.com/writing-sample/writing-task-2/3564-advantages-and-disadvantages-of-new-approach-in-teaching"}, {"essay_topic": "Some people think that students in single-sex schools perform better academically. Others, however, believe that mixed schools provide children with better social skills for adult life.", "extra_topic": "Discuss both these views and give your own opinion.", "model_answer": "Whether single-sex schools render more benefits than mixed school settings has sparked a heated debate. Some people affirm that students in male or female-only schools have better chances for academic achievements, whereas many others argue that co-ed schools offer students better social skills for their future. Personally, I am in favour of the latter view.\n\nAdmittedly, single-sex schools have fewer distractions. The reason for this is if a school has only boys or girls, students would not be distracted by members of the opposite sex at school; hence, they can focus on their learning. Even so, these students still have access to the other gender after school, which means in reality, they must meet the other gender anyway. Consequently, the benefits of single-sex schools are quite limited.\n\nOn the contrary, convincing arguments can be made that mixed schools provide a more comprehensive learning environment for children. To start with, students studying at mixed schools have more chances to communicate with members of the opposite sex. In other words, children learn how to talk to the other gender at an early age; therefore, their social skills would certainly be fostered. Moreover, mixed schools give students opportunities to deal with conflicts with the other gender, which strengthens students\u2019 problem-solving skills. For instance, when a boy has a conflict with a girl at school, both of them must learn how to cope. This lesson must be learned sooner or later; as a result, students benefit more if they can learn it sooner. Finally, mixed schools provide students with a real-life scenario where both genders co-exist. Specifically, students can learn in an organic environment in which boys and girls must know how to interact with each other.\n\nIn conclusion, I would concede that single-sex schools have some advantages. Despite that, combined schools certainly support students in a much better way. Overall, I am convinced that students should go to mixed schools for better professional, social and adult life.", "original_link": "https://www.ielts-mentor.com/writing-sample/writing-task-2/3563-students-in-single-sex-schools-perform-better"}, {"essay_topic": "Road accidents are more frequent these days and claim many lives each year. As a result, some people suggest that drivers should take regular driving tests throughout their lives, rather than one single driving test, to improve the situation.", "extra_topic": "What do you think are the advantages and disadvantages of repeat driving tests?\nDo the advantages outweigh the disadvantages?", "model_answer": " (Advantages outweigh the disadvantages)The growing number of cars and reckless driving are the major causes of increasing road accidents these days. Therefore, many people, as well as some politicians, express their view that repetitive driving tests, and not just one test to get the licence, should be in place. This essay outlines some advantages as well as disadvantages of the continuous testing process and opines that this has more benefits.\n\nTo start with the demerits, multiple tests may unnecessarily impose a burden on people. This is because they will have to prepare for the test, pay for it, and allocate time for the test in order to renew the licence. As a result, many people may tend to avoid the tests, and one day, get pulled over and fined for an outdated licence. Moreover, it will cost money to the authority as well. Therefore, it may not solve the issue easily while both the drivers and the authority will be under pressure.\n\nTo outline the advantages, road safety in a country is a major concern and so is the obligation of legislators regarding this. Increasing vehicular movements and driver's recklessness is primarily responsible for accidents on the roads. Drivers get outdated and more inept to new road rules and safety practices. For example, with age, many drivers may not see the traffic signals and road signs easily. As a result, such drivers may potentially hit other moving vehicles and people. Therefore, the repeat tests for driving, from time to time, will definitely improve the safety on roads. Moreover, many young drivers do not abide by the traffic rules, and continuous tests would ensure their awareness of safe driving. Finally, when people will have to take driving tests periodically, they will remain updated about traffic and safety rules.\n\nIn conclusion, reoccurring driving tests improve people's driving accuracy, make them aware of safety and laws, and find out potentially risky drivers. So the benefits of such tests surpass the drawbacks.\n\n[Written by - Kris Nirvana]", "original_link": "https://www.ielts-mentor.com/writing-sample/writing-task-2/3556-advantages-and-disadvantages-of-repeat-driving-tests"}, {"essay_topic": "In the past, people used to travel to see the differences from their home country.

However, this trend is accompanied by many complaints that similarities of the landscapes considerably reduce the delights and attractions of the travel. Globalisation, in my mind, is the greatest reason for the similarities.\n\nNo doubt, globalisation unifies the world in many different aspects. Girls in Shanghai can be witnessed to have the same street look as those in Paris and Milan; KFC and Pizza Hut are popular in Bangkok as they are back in California; the amazing film \"2012\" was premiered internationally at the same moment. Tourist attractions cannot escape from this sweeping trend. Therefore, it is quite normal to hear comments from a tourist in Hong Kong, claiming that what he or she has seen is just the same as in Tokyo.\n\nThis phenomenon, to me, is a depressing one. People may have sacrificed too many of their cultural identities for this. Culture is our ancestors' most treasurable heritage that is supposed to be passed on from generation to generation. It would be disastrous if people could only recall those busy shopping streets instead of the traditional lanes and houses after their trip to Vietnam. And I remember how frustrated I was when I found a lot of popular souvenirs in some foreign countries that could be bought back in Ho Chi Minh City \u2014 those delicate wooden sculptures really seemed far less appealing to me.\n\nSince the trend of globalisation is inevitable, I suggest that both the government and the public make joint efforts in protecting and preserving their unique cultural features.

However, I feel that while modern technologies, such as computers and the Internet, are important in assisting a child's learning, this learning should be guided and directed by the experience of human teachers.\n\nUndeniably, computers and the Internet are popularly used in education and they can present knowledge in a vivid and novel way. The computer and the Internet can also enable students in enhancing their general understanding of how to solve difficulties in the study as well as giving them vital skills in readiness for later life. However, the problems are - the information that the computer can show has to be preprogrammed and needs constant updating. For example, the Internet may not be always a reliable source for knowledge, since there is often conflicting and fake information available when taken from unauthentic sources.\n\nA traditional and long-established practice is for children to study and gain knowledge at school, learning skills in various ways taught by traditional methods by teachers. A school is a place where students gather to be educated and learn from each other and human educators. At school, students' development is orchestrated stage by stage, step by step by experienced teachers, and their acquisition of knowledge is guided and backed up systematically.\n\nTo conclude, I do not believe that it will help students to learn effectively and in an impressive manner to overemphasising the use of computers and the Internet.

At present, shopping as a favourite pastime activity is becoming extremely popular, especially among youngsters. Admittedly, shopping outlet\u2019s services, lucrative offers, rapid changes in technology, and digital advertisements are playing key roles in making this trend popular. However, unnecessary shopping is a waste of time and money which could be better utilised by youths.\n\nThe modern world we live in has too many new technologies, gadgets, and fashion items and they change so frequently that it is almost impossible to remain fashionable, trendy and updated without shopping regularly. Many people, especially youngsters, go shopping very frequently because they feel those items are necessary for them. Since brands release new items quite often, the young generation goes shopping frequently. Digital advertisements by big and small brands also reach millions of youngsters and constantly lure them to get fashionable items to look and feel good, and sometimes their offer and discounts are too good to be missed! For instance, renowned brands like Nike or some small brands often give up to 50% discount which drags many youngsters to their outlets.\n\nYouths can use their leisure time in more productive activities and hobbies like going out and doing exercise, socialising with others, getting involved in charity works and taking part in different outdoor sports. This will keep them mentally and physically fit and make a far more healthy young generation without chronic diseases and obesity. Besides, they can invest time in reading, which will broaden their imagination, teach them different information and make them ready for their future career. For instance, it is evident that students who like to read a lot do much better in exams and end up having a better career than those who hardly read outside their academic books.\n\nTo conclude, I believe that shopping is important when it is restricted to buying necessary items.

Do you think that governments should impose extra taxes on flights or accommodation to restrict today\u2019s tourism industry?", "extra_topic": "", "model_answer": "Nowadays, environmental issues caused both by tourists and tourism-related activities have become so grave that many people insist that governments should impose hefty taxes on air travels and hotels for the sake of restricting the tourist inflow. I, however, disagree with this notion and believe that the authority should find better measures rather than limiting the tourism industry.\n\nThe key reason why I believe that governments ought to avoid levying more taxes on flights and accommodations is that tourism creates employment for local people and make economic movements in the region. It also brings significant foreign remittance to the country. Many countries, St. Lucia, Maldives and Thailand, for example, heavily depend on the steady earning their tourism sector brings for them. It also makes people tolerant of different cultures and let them learn about diverse cultures and traditions. If more taxes are imposed on the movement and accommodation of tourists, it would bring catastrophic results for many countries. Therefore, measures which would entail a decline in tourist should not be implemented.\n\nTo control pollution and excessive wastages, authorities can employ workers to clean their surroundings while instructing visitors not to pollute the environment. Policies to improve the manners of tourists while staying in a foreign country should be implemented. Improving public buses and dedicating transports for tourists can reduce traffic congestions to a great extent. Moreover, scientific research and engineering feats can reduce the pollution created by vehicles and aeroplanes to a great extend and money should be spent on such research works. These solutions would improve the situation on the one hand, and not deprive citizens of jobs and economic freedom on the other hand.\n\nTo conclude, extra levies on tourist transportation and accommodation will limit the inflow of tourists, putting local citizen\u2019s livelihood at risk, especially in tourism-dependant countries.

This essay discusses the disadvantages of playing digital games on computer devices by youngsters and suggests some measures to reduce such negative effects.\n\nConcerning the adverse impacts of young children playing video games, the most devastating one is the addiction these games create. Millions of dollar are spent to make computer games so that they attract a large audience and keep them glued to the computer screens. So they are addictive by design and this obsession hampers children's outdoor activities, studies and even time to socialise and learn important life skills. Many research works suggest that children who spend many hours playing computer games end up performing poorly in schools and avoid social events and outdoor activities. This results in physical and psychological issues including poor eyesight and despair. Moreover, violent games cloud the youngsters' judgement and make their rational thinking unstable. Oftentimes, youngsters who play violent games develop violent behaviours.\n\nTo minimise the severity of these negative impacts, parents must monitor what their children are doing, especially on computers. They should not be allowed to play computer games for more than a couple of hours each week and parents can actively take part in those games with their children so that it becomes family time. Children's outdoor activities should be taken seriously and parents should take them out whenever possible. Finally, parents can use parental control over the digital contents and games their children watch or play.

With smartphones and tablets, we can now watch movies anywhere and anytime. Some people believe that this is a substitute for going to the cinema. However, I would argue that movie theatres deliver an unparalleled experience as not all movies can be enjoyed on small screens.\n\nOn the one hand, the advent of smart devices has put the cinema business at stake. Recently, many people have begun relying on their smartphones to watch their favourite videos and movies at their convenience. For example, many mobile applications, such as Netflix, provide users access to millions of contents at an affordable price, including those that are not shown in theatres.

Such disasters have stemmed from work pressure, lack of physical exercise and dependency on machines to do human's work. Exercises, outdoor activities and encouragement by the employer and the government to do workout and finally, a balanced diet is a solution to this problem.\n\nOne of the primary reasons for working people not to do enough or any exercise is the abysmal working condition where working life is extremely competitive and full of anxiety. Employers have constant deadlines, tough targets, and to achieve them, workers have to work for long hours each day which drain their stamina. As a consequence, workers do not want to do any exercise even when they are at home. In addition, dependency on technology has fueled up the condition. Due to technological advancements, people have exchanged the available time for exercise with browsing the internet, watching television and checking their accounts on social media websites. They also prefer to drive than to walk, use washing machines than to clean their clothes manually and use machines to do most of their works, which in turn, has negative impacts on their life and health.\n\nPhysical exercise is a must to remain fit and those workers have to stop leading a sedentary lifestyle and start moving. The government can facilitate outdoor activities so that people get out and take part in those activities after office hours. Employers have to realise that healthy employees mean better productivity and should arrange exercise facilities at the office premises. They can do so by encouraging their employees to do some exercise at a certain time of the day during office hours.

It symbolises harmony and reflects humanity. I quite agree that music helps bring people from various cultures and generations together.\n\nOne of the reasons music excretes the hurdles among different nations and cultures is that people enjoy music from every part of the world, and it speaks the same language, which embodies human emotion, joy, love and sorrow. Music does not need interpretation to be enjoyed and understood as it touches our heart and resonates in our mind. No matter what language we speak or understand, we appreciate the melody and depth of music which is why people of all ages can sit together and enjoy the same music.\n\nMoreover, nations influence each other with the type of music they produce and the type of musical instruments they use. This amalgamation reduces cultural differences and brings people from different cultures and ages to a common platform. For example, many music genres, that we enjoy these days, were derived from multiple nations and cultures and people from all these cultures enjoy and love them.\n\nMusic is an art form which is enjoyed by all, and this helps reduce the generation and age gaps among people. For instance, when the national anthem is played, child, adults and elders all tune to the same emotion, which is patriotism, and their unity is stronger than ever. The same can be said when music evokes other emotions like love, sadness and so on.

This has primarily happened due to the mass migration to cities for better career options. The establishment of pristine societies and self-reliant suburban systems can improve the situation dramatically.\n\nThis urban sprawl could be attributed to several causes. Firstly, the migration of skilled and unskilled workers from rural to modernized societies, seeking a better job and higher quality of life, have accelerated it. Secondly, city-centric education, healthcare and other amenities have tempted people to move to cities. This colossal movement of population to metro areas have increased the costs while declined the living standard.

That could be achieved by developing schools, social amenities and health care services and setting higher minimum wages in towns and rural areas.\n\nIn conclusion, the explosion of profound municipalities kills our future and hope.

That is why many employers seek ways to offer perks, such as gyms or sports clubs sponsorship, with a belief that healthier and happier employees will become more productive at work while many other employers simply do not invest in it. The essay will examine both sides, but I personally believe that various other motivations and rewards, in combination with this initiative, will bring effective results.\n\nThe proponent of gyms or sports club subsidy offered by employers believes that physical and mental wellness is a prerequisite for optimal work performance. It is evident that sportive people are less likely to get sick, take fewer sick leaves and hence bring the least disruptions to daily operation in their workplace. Furthermore, sport is a good way to build team spirit and promote interpersonal skills. Thus the harmonious professional relationship that results from workers hitting the gyms or playing sports will certainly facilitate work efficacy. Moreover, sports club sponsorship by companies will implicitly convey the message that employers do care about the wellness of their employees alongside profit-making. Perhaps, employees will pay extra effort at work if they are valued. For instance, some of my friends speak highly of their employers because they feel their office authority takes care of their wellbeing by offering the facility to hit the gym.\n\nConversely, the opponent of gyms or sports facility funding says that companies should focus on incentives that really matter to employees instead, namely job prospects, pay increments, job satisfaction, training opportunities, reasonable workloads and holidays. If employees\u2019 performances are directly linked to their pay increments or career progression, they should have enough tangible rewards to work effectively.

With a monstrous population and limited resource and wealth, people are going to face much more obstacles in the next ten years. Cultivable lands are being converted to living space, cities are getting more polluted due to overpopulation, and poverty is setting in more deeply. As a result, illiteracy and poverty rates are ever-increasing. Both problems are interconnected and that is why they are harder for the government and citizens to tackle. For example, according to Oxford University, 80% of Indians will live below the poverty line and the illiteracy rate will be higher among such a destitute population.\n\nSome possible solutions to these imminent problems are that the government has to come with strict guidelines for making primary and secondary education free and mandatory. The local administration should make every possible arrangement to attract children to schools. For example, free meals in school, in neighbouring Pakistan, have brought a good result and similar steps could be taken in India as well. As for the population problem, the one-child policy should be strictly enforced and the awareness programmes and campaigns can be a silver bullet for this problem.\n\nIn conclusion, the biggest challenge for India in the next ten years is to control poverty and ensure education for all. The government, local administration and citizens should all participate and contribute to eliminating illiteracy and controlling rampant population growth.", "original_link": "https://www.ielts-mentor.com/writing-sample/writing-task-2/3502-what-problems-will-your-country-face-in-next-ten-years"}, {"essay_topic": "The environmental problems that today's world is facing are so great that there is little ordinary people can do to improve the situation. So governments and large organizations should be responsible for reducing the amount of damage being done to the environment.", "extra_topic": "", "model_answer": " [Disagreement]\nGovernments, environmentalists and large organisations, in many countries, are trying to curb environmental problems, and a part of this effort is to make aware people of how they can contribute to environmental issues. It is surprising how our dietary habits or the dresses we wear can all contribute to the environmental problems and that is why without involving ordinary citizens, government bodies and private organisations can not reverse the downward fall when it comes to the environment.\n\nTo begin with, our environment is becoming worse with every passing day and without awareness among ordinary citizens, it will become impossible to achieve environmental protection. We, as ordinary citizens, are constantly contributing to global warming, pollution and climate change. The car we drive exhaust carbon dioxide, the dresses we wear require a huge amount of fibres and water, the plastic bags we use end up in the water, and even the diets we follow can increase the possibility of climate change. Thus, if people are not made cognizant of their actions that are directly or indirectly responsible for global warming, they will not fully comprehend the gravity of the intricacies and feel responsible. Climate change is so large a problem that only governments and large organizations can not work to find a solution for that and a coordinated effort is required.\n\nIt is undeniable that countries have taken serious steps to curb environmental problems and our leaders are meeting frequently to discuss it. Restrictions are in place on gas emissions, fossils fuel use, plastic production and use, and alternative sources of green energy are being invested upon. But if the efforts are not made at an individual level, the magnitude of damage and pollutions would far outstrip the efforts. Finally, scientists, engineers, environmentalists and authority may come out with proposal and invest money in research, but they can not control the amount of plastic bags we use and throw away without recycling. Every environmental problem is related to our human lifestyle and unconsciousness, and it is high time to include the syllabus about environmental protection in our school. We have got only one planet to live on and we must save it.\n\nIn conclusion, whatever we do to the environment will return and affect us and all level of education should emphasize how we can be more responsible to protect it. A joint approach by the authority and mass people can only make it happen.Sample Answer 2: [Partially Agreement - A collaborated approach is required.]\nNowadays, environmental issues have become bigger and more crucial than at any time in the past. Some believe that authorities, large firms and manufacturers can play a fundamental role in reversing the detrimental damages done to the environment while ordinary people have little to contribute. From my perspective, although the governments and large companies must take immediate actions regarding saving the earth, people and their lifestyle and awareness can be beneficial to a great extent.\n\nNo doubt, the earth is confronting devastating threats, and it is imperative to take some radical moves immediately. First of all, authorities should dedicate a large amount of budget to improve the public transport infrastructures and enact some strict regulations and laws regarding usage or ownership of private vehicles. They generate a considerable volume of greenhouse gases, which are considered the main culprit behind global warming. Secondly, it should be compulsory for companies to be based on renewable resources of energy for their productions. Also, they should limit their productions to the proportion of demand because mass production not only threatens the natural resources but is also primarily responsible for endless rubbish and harmful pollutants that overwhelmingly harm nature.\n\nIn addition to the actions required by the government and organisations, people need to be active in saving the mother planet. One of the most important approaches for that is waste separation by people. If they separate the biodegradable and non-biodegradable garbage from the origin, from homes, they will effectively reduce the recycling strain, which is profoundly time, money, and energy-consuming. Furthermore, the more they raise themselves and consequently their children's awareness of the environment and how crucial it is to be preserved, the more world will remain healthy and sustainable.\n\nIn conclusion, governments and large companies must initiate immediate and radical operations for the sake of the earth's survival, and people still can play a significant role in diverse aspects of the earth's well-being.\n\n[Written by - Mahsa]", "original_link": "https://www.ielts-mentor.com/writing-sample/writing-task-2/3415-environmental-problems-world-is-facing-are-so-great"}, {"essay_topic": "Fossil fuel, such as coal, oil and natural gas, is extensively used in many countries which cause harms to the environment.

Is this a positive or negative development?", "extra_topic": "", "model_answer": "\nFossil fuel, though extensively used, is not eco-friendly and its usage comes with huge environmental costs. Considering global warming and climate change, and the detrimental effects fossil fuels have on the environment and public health, green fuel, such as solar, hydro and wind power, could be the answer to our future energy demand. It is a good thing that many countries have already started using these green power sources.\n\nThe demand for fuels is rapidly increasing in many countries with the population rise. It is also associated with industrialisation and it seems only obvious that oil, coal and natural gas-rich countries would largely use them to take the leverage of their stock of such energy sources. For instance, Russia has natural gas, China and India are rich in coal and the USA and OPEC countries has a huge stockpile of oil. Besides, other developed countries that do not have a huge stock of such fuel, import them from other countries at a considerably cheap price. However, the stock of fossil fuel is limited and would get exhausted at a certain point. So, alternative and green sources, which is renewable, would be the main source of our energy in the future and we should get ready for the time when we will have no new oil or gas stock. Since green energy like wind and solar energy is renewable, their use should be as much encouraged as possible from right now and it is a good thing that the trend has already started.\n\n\nAlternative sources of power, such as solar and wind power, do not pollute the environment, have lower carbon emission and are eco-friendly. So their use could save the planet from the disaster of global warming which is already visible around us. Wind power and solar power are in use in countries like Denmark, Germany and France and more and more countries are joining the list. We already have an extremely efficient technology to produce solar and wind power and the trend is quite encouraging.\n\n\nThe energy demand is increasing at a fast pace and the stock of fossil fuel is diminishing. So we should turn to alternative green energy sources and share the technology and expertise with all nations so that the transition happens all around the world to save our otherwise dying planet due to climate change and greenhouse effects.

However, these advantages come with a cost, and environmental degradations and traffic congestions are two major concerns. We can improve the public transportation system and increase fuel price to discourage people from using private cars often.\n\nProblems associated with increasing car use are huge and its environmental impacts are a great concern for many.  Automobiles are a big source of carbon dioxide emission and greenhouse effects and not to mention, air and sound pollutions in urban areas all around the world. Vehicle exhausts contribute to global warming, acid rain and many health-related problems. Climate change is already affecting millions of people's lives and hurting the ecological balance, and it is terrifying to think about what the ever-increasing vehicles on the roads would do to our planet in the future unless we do something to reverse it. Moreover, personal cars are the reason we face so horrendous traffic jam almost every day which kills our valuable time and negatively affect our productivity.\n\nTo address these problems, some people suggest that the government should impose a strict restriction on car ownership and increase the tax on car purchasing to a staggering height. However, the mobility and flexibility of personal cars are essential in our life, and I am absolutely against taking any drastic measures. Rather, we should improve our public transportation facility to a great extent so that people prefer to use public buses and trains rather than driving. Another measure could be slowly increasing the fuel price that would deter many middle-class people from using and driving cars. Moreover, car manufacturers should invest in environment-friendly solar or hydrogen-powered cars to reduce the negative impacts of cars on the environment and the government should improve the roads to reduce traffic congestions.\n\nIn conclusion, restricting the use of cars overnight might seem like a quick and effective solution, but practically speaking, it is not a proper solution.

While many people believe that toddlers should start school as early as possible, others think that they should stay home until they turn six or seven. I, wholeheartedly, agree with the latter view.\n\nThe main reason most parents want their infants to join the school is to learn the fundamental things early. Undoubtedly, this is the age when a child's cognitive development occurs at a full pace, and schools are expected to provide them ample opportunities to learn and grab new things as compared to home. In schools, they will not only learn important subjects like \"Mathematics\" or \"English\" but also other behaviours and ethical aspects which will help in shaping their future.\n\nOn the flip side, children till the age of six or seven should spend time with their parents at home as they learn what they see, play with, or observe. In other words, they cannot distinguish between good and bad habits and can be misguided easily at school by peers. In addition to this, pressure in schools may restrict their ability to play freely and learn from their surroundings. Schools are often accused of restricting freedom and following strict rules, which is not a positive way of teaching young children. A recent survey in Washington has revealed that many schools education policy puts too much emphasis on formal learning and robs children of their creative abilities.  \n\nTo recapitulate, despite some benefits of starting school early, I think infants should not be sent to school until the age of six or seven to protect them from learning bad habits and provide them more independence to cherish their childhood and learn naturally.\n\n[Written by - Deepak]", "original_link": "https://www.ielts-mentor.com/writing-sample/writing-task-2/3405-young-children-to-go-to-school-as-soon-as-possible"}, {"essay_topic": "The main purpose of public libraries is to provide books, and they should not waste their limited resources and space on providing expensive hi-tech media such as computer software, videos and DVDs.", "extra_topic": "", "model_answer": " [Disagree]\nTraditionally, a library is a place that shelves many books that readers can read or borrow. However, technological advancement and its tremendous effects on the way we learn new things and share information have redefined the concept of a library in recent days. Thus digital contents and technological facilities are widely used in public libraries all around the world and I quite disagree with the notion that these amenities are a waste of resource or space for a library.\n\nOpposers of high-tech libraries often argue that they distract readers and costs more money. I, however, believe that libraries with modern facilities are far more useful to readers and allow the librarian to manage its collection in a more organised fashion. Multimedia resources offer readers a dynamic combination of images, sounds, videos and virtual tours. Thus listening to a famous historical speech or taking a virtual tour at the Colosseum is far more interactive and exciting than just reading about them. Moreover, multimedia facilities and DVDs in a library may initially seem expensive, but they preserve valuable resources for a longer time and contain important information for future research and reference. To cite an example, a single DVD can store the entire volume of Encyclopedia Britannica which would otherwise occupy a large shelf of a library.\n\nInterestingly, a public library can actually save money and space and attract more readers with the use of technology and interactive contents. When they have computers and library management software, they barely need many staff members. Besides, it takes great effort to protect books from moisture, fire and human damages but digital contents can easily be copied and preserved for as many years as we want. As for attracting young generations, a high-tech library is more successful.\n\nTo conclude, the transformation of public libraries have made them more beneficial to readers and researchers as they now work as centres for interactive learning and knowledge sharing.

However, we then began to over utilise this authority and damage nature to an extent that is catastrophic for the entire human race. Global warming and environmental pollutions are threatening our very existence on this planet and yet we are neglecting our obligations to protect the environment primarily because we fail to realise the real consequences of it and believe that it can be dealt with in the future.\n\nThe first reason for this is our incompetency to understand the dire consequences of climate change. Despite frequent headlines on TV and in newspapers all over the world, we are still oblivious to the fate of the world. When we are working hard to save some money to build a house or have a car in the future, we cannot fathom how many parts of the world would become unlivable due to the sea level rise and pollutions. If we only knew, we would have taken preserving nature as seriously as we take our own profession or future. Moreover, many people feel that environmental problems are too complex to control through individual actions, which I believe is a misguided idea.\n\nAnother reason we are indifferent towards environmental degradation is our false confidence that it could be dealt with in the future. As a result, we are concerned about solving more immediate problems such as housing shortage or traffic congestion than to prevent the disaster that is only predicted to happen in the future.

In my opinion, a job should have ethical demands and needs to be passion-oriented.

No doubt, passion acts as the fuel that drives people to withstand the caustic side of their work. If people chose a job that is not connected to their passion, they will fall victim to depression and perform poorly at their jobs. On the other hand, if we torch upon successful people's stories, we would find that almost all of them have been in the career that they were passionate about. Suppose Bill Gates or Steve Jobs, both of them were tech enthusiasts, and therefore took technology as the means of their career.\n\nBesides, a job needs to be ethically demanding where people need to find something to do for humanity and society. Doing something for people not only will provide mental satisfaction but also will strengthen the purpose of their job life. Take Mother Theresa or Nelson Mandala for an example.

The transformation towards a cashless society might be slow, but steady and widespread. This paradigm shift has both positive and negative consequences and this essay deals with both of them.\n\nPrimarily, electronic transactions and plastic card payments are more convenient and are processed on the go. People neither have to carry a bulk amount of cash nor write a check - which usually takes a couple of days to clear the payment. The electronic payment system is global in nature and hassle-free. Consequently, the eCommerce industry has flourished and many individuals have their own online business without any brick and mortar shop.

Although we can use these cards due to technological advancement, the risks of using plastic money, however, pertain to this technology. The primary threat to such payment mode is cybersecurity and hacking. For example, once a credit card is cloned or its sensitive data is hacked, the owner would suffer a great financial loss.

Unfortunately, this opinion is misguided. I strongly believe that handwriting skill is important even in today\u2019s digital world.\n\nGood handwriting is important because when children learn to write clearly and concisely, they also learn how to express themselves properly. This leads to better academic and professional performance. I reckon handwriting is much more than simply putting letters on a page; it is a key part of learning and expressing ideas. Scrawls that cannot be read may be compared to speaking that cannot be understood. Handwriting is also important because children are required to use it daily in school, and those who struggle with the mechanics of handwriting may have trouble taking notes or completing their schoolwork. This can affect both their self-esteem and their attitude toward school. Good penmanship means better grades as studies show that the same mediocre paper is graded much higher if the handwriting is neat.\n\nMore importantly, handwriting proficiency inspires confidence despite some people's belief that handwriting is not related to better academic performance. The more children practise a skill such as handwriting, the stronger the motor pathways become until the skill becomes automatic. Furthermore, handwriting aids memory. For example, if a person writes a list or a note and then loses it, he is more likely to remember what he wrote than if he just tries to memorize it.\n\nIn conclusion, computer and digital data have no way replaced the necessity of handwriting skills.

I completely agree with this view and this will be shown in this essay by analysing the copiousness of the culture brought in by different nationalities and how a country can utilise distinct strengths of people from different races and nationalities.\n\nTo begin with, the more diverse the nationalities in a country, the richer its culture becomes. For instance, people over a hundred nationalities reside in Dubai and this leads to the availability of hundreds of different cuisines throughout the country. As a result, Dubai is called the \u2018food capital\u2019 of the Middle East. This, in turn, attracts tourists from all over the world who come to explore this richness in culture in Dubai.

For example, Singaporeans and other Asians are generally better at math, while Africans are known for their strength.

Doctors, engineers, nurses, sales executives and many other professionals have to visit their workplaces and meet people to execute their responsibilities. Similarly, if we shop online, dispatch staff will still be on the road to deliver products.

One such solution can be improving public transportation. The convenience of public conveyance would discourage many to use their private cars, which is the primary reason for bad traffic in many cities. Furthermore, the government can encourage people to use an eco-friendly mode of transport, like the bicycle, by dedicating a separate lane for them.

They believe that learning technology and science can bring significantly more benefits to humankind and the knowledge could be utilised for future development. History, on the contrary, has no utilisation in our daily life, according to them. For instance, science students can experiment and build helpful tools and devices, and this can lead to a magnificent future invention while pupils from history major are imposed to memorize dates and events from the past.\n\nBut this is not the whole picture according to many others. Learning history not only tells us about past events but also prepares us for the future. We can not expect to avoid a large-scale catastrophe if we do not know why it happened in the first place. In the 19th century, for example, Ireland suffered the blight of potatoes, known as the Irish Potato Famine, and it happened because the Irish were largely dependent on potatoes. Had they plant another crop, this could have been avoided. However, this unpleasant history has taught us a great lesson - to cultivate a wide diversity of crops. Finally, teaching history in school helps foster patriotism among the youth which is quite important for a bright future generation.\n\nIn conclusion, people learn important lessons from experience and to build a prosperous nation, we must learn from our history which offers the greatest experience of all.

Thus the curriculum they follow to teach pupils has a profound impact on its overall outcome. Though some scholars believe that teaching a wide range of subjects at the tertiary level is far more beneficial than restraining the syllabus to a few particular subjects, I have reasons to disagree with this view.\n\nFirst of all, universities cannot teach all the subjects to the disciples and the notion of teaching them a great number of subjects is impractical. For instance, an average university has more than 30 departments and they are meant to specialise students in a particular field, not make them the jack of all trades only to produce mediocre professionals. Many public universities are already struggling to finish the course in time and if more subjects are added, that would simply make the scenario worse.\n\nFurthermore, a medical student, when forced to study history and poetry, would feel less connected to those subjects, ultimately ending with less specialised knowledge and skill. Similarly, a student from literature would find solving higher calculus a real challenge. The university already has its departments that pick students based on their merits and interests and the course offering should stick to that.\n\nFinally, someone does not need to excel in all subjects to do better in his profession. If an engineering student is interested in studying history, he can always do so even the university curriculum does not include it. Many eminent scientists had little knowledge of other subjects and that did not deter them from changing the world forever and this can be a great example of how specific subjects at the tertiary level can be beneficial than the idea of adding a list of unrelated subjects.\n\nTo conclude, the areas of studies, especially in this modern era, are myriad and thus adding a spectrum of subjects in every major is not a practical idea.

In the pre-internet era, it was confined to posts and TV and could attract a nominal number of learners. Despite a boom in home-based learning trend due to technological advancements, it is not as beneficial as attending a formal educational institute, as far as I am concerned.\n\nTo begin with, university education is not restricted to some textbook lessons as it also focuses on creating an enlightened generation through a favourable environment where students learn to interact with each other, discover the diversity of cultures, and learn to face real-life challenges. Some video scripts and printed documents cannot teach them how to use those in the practical world. For instance, someone who learns a skill online finds it difficult to implement it in the real world. Thus their poor performance in professional life is imminent.\n\nMoreover, instructors have extensive experience in dealing with students from different backgrounds and modify their lessons according to the capacity of the students. This is completely missing in the distance learning method and thus the single-package-fits-all model is less productive. Taking an online course to learn to play the guitar could be a classic example. A recent study by the University of Sussex reveals that nine out of ten online guitar learners fail to master it due to the lack of motivation and this is where the formal education comes in - motivating students. Taking distance learning courses for learning a programming language, or how to cook a cuisine can be useful for many but this can never be the alternatives to education we receive from colleges and universities.\n\nTo conclude, we attend educational institutes to learn and become enlightened citizens, not to memorise lessons and pass exams.

This new trend has many negative impacts on people and society as a whole. This essay will argue why it is completely unnecessary for people to spend their free time in the marketplace and how this is a negative trend.\n\nTo begin with, modern shopping complexes offer many amenities and shoppers tend to enjoy roaming around different markets and purchase whatever they like. For instance, many pupils prefer to meet up in a shopping mall, watch a movie and later have snacks in the food court. They say this reduces the stress of the exams and make them relaxed. Besides, with the decline of open places and parks, many families gather at a large shopping mall to enjoy their holidays. However, this is a negative trend and has health hazards.\n \nAs a consequence, the young generation tends to forget the beauty of nature and the stress relief provided by the outdoor world. This, in fact, drains out the energy of the youth and makes them lethargic. For example, a walk in a park or a day on a beach refreshes the soul more evidently than a day in a mall. Besides, due to the excessive affection towards shopping, many people become shopaholics and get into debt.\n\nTo conclude, citizens should not spend their free time in shopping malls as there are better alternatives.

Though direct guidance of a native English teacher can be of great help, I do not consider it the best approach as there are other better methods to learn this language.\n\nTo begin with, a teacher from an English-speaking country use the language in his or her daily life and know the context of a word, phrase and grammatical rule. Since command of a language requires more than learning the syntax, a teacher from a country like the UK or the USA can guide a student to learn about the practical use of the language and can effectively correct the student. For instance, most of the non-native students who pursue their university education in an English-speaking country become better users of English from the guideline they get from native teachers.\n\nHowever, mentorship from the native tutors is one of the ways to be fluent in English, not the best way. Self-study, exposure to English-speaking people and their cultures, online language courses, devotion and extensive reading habits can be more effective to be a good user of English. For instance, millions of self-made writers, journalists and interpreters have had no access to native teachers. Furthermore, passion to learn a language can often make someone versed in the language as these people invest a great deal of time to learn it from books and online resources. To cite an example, I studied in a school where roughly one in five students was from English-speaking countries but most of the composition contest prizes went to non-natives.\n\nTo conclude, having a teacher who is from an English-speaking country is undeniably a great way to have better exposure to the language but this is not the finest way to become versed in English.

Minor psychological issues are often ignored by the family while severe cases are inappropriately treated only to tag them as madmen. There is no denying that mental illness, compared to physical diseases, does not get proper care and acceptance from society all around the world.\n\nTo begin with, the number of general hospitals and the specialist doctors and nurses devoted to treating diseases of our body is overwhelmingly higher than the healthcare centre and staffs allocated for mental complexities. Someone just needs to walk a few blocks to notice a hospital in any city. However, this is not the case for clinics that deal with patients\u2019 mental issues. This is huge discrimination when World Health Organization clearly outlines the number of patients who need psychotherapists, mental support and treatment for their psychological intricacies.\n\nMoreover, social views towards a physically sick child are different than an autistic child.

This raises a serious question of moral integrity and social norm towards people who need special care. Due to the astigmatism of our social and healthcare system, we have so many cases of mental issues which go untreated.

In this digital era, information spread like wildfire and for the sake of maintaining global peace, it should be delimited, according to many.

Owing to historical or political reasons, not all countries are at peace with each other. Admittedly, sports evoke similar pleasure and satisfaction as a victory in a war does but it brings nations together.

Besides, when such unpremeditated convicts are expelled from society, they incline to re-offend in isolation as there is none to accept them. Apart from this, juvenile delinquents should be rehabilitated by indulging them in community services. A recent study reveals that many youngsters who had been in prison for a long time often end up becoming even bigger criminals.\n\nHowever, brutal offenders who commit heinous crimes like premeditated murder, vandalism, abduction, hijacking, rapes and so on should be punished to set examples in society. Thus, the background of a criminal and the motif of a crime should be considered. For instance, if a teenager steals food from a store as his mother is starving is a completely different crime than someone robbing an old lady and stabbing her violently. The former deserves a second chance while the latter should be imprisoned.\n\nTo recapitulate, someone with no previous record of crime and a sensible reason for minor misconduct should be treated differently than a serial killer.

Their sublime design attracts tourists and locals alike and is quite rare in modern structures. These historical edifices also give us an opportunity to learn about the glorious past. For example, the Roman Colosseum in Rome not only shows how awe-inspiring the ancient architectures were but also points out a massive arena used as a stadium for gladiators' fighting and has space to house around 50,000 spectators in tiered seating. This structure is a predominant representative of Roman culture and civilisation that modern historians cherish profoundly.\n\nIn addition to this, historical monuments also serve as tourist magnetism in many countries.

We can judge him from the way he dresses, speaks, starts a conversation and expresses his views. This is often the true reflection of a person's character. But this can often be ambiguous.

Only a long-term observation can express their true nature and intention. From this regard, I would not agree with the view that my initial impressions about someone are always right.

Not only it creates job opportunities, but also help people become aware of the socio-economic issues of the country. Making education free till the age of 18 would encourage the pupils to finish at least their secondary education. For instance, the percentage of student enrollment in schools in 2011 in my country increased by 19% than that of 2009, and it was because the government exempted fees for students in these classes.\n\nMoreover, the healthcare system can also be improved by providing either health insurance or schemes that cover a minimum of 50 per cent of the cost. Thus people would not feel that healthcare is expensive while the government would not need to bear the expenses alone. A healthier nation can help the country achieve greater heights as citizens in such countries are more productive.

I believe that the way children take responsibilities has changed over time, mostly as a positive development, and to what extent a youth should carry out these liabilities should be determined by the family and social condition.\n\nTo begin with, the social, economic and family structure in the past, in most of the countries, forced parents to distribute responsibilities among children and it was common for many young children to work hard and take care of younger family members besides their education. These young children learnt how to manage budgets, share with other family members and take challenges in life.

Joint family predominated society and parents had more children in the past. With the rise of the nuclear family and one-to-two-child-family policy, parents now focus on children's education, unlike in the past. In my opinion, blaming children for not taking responsibilities is an impartial judgement as modern children have far more pressure from schools, society and parents. They are not expected to earn money or do household works in a well-to-do family. With the increasing literacy rates, gender equality, women empowerment and a better lifestyle, the trend has more positive outcomes, without a doubt.\n \nTo conclude, these days, we want our children to be the best scorer, best athlete, and outshine in everything they do unlike the past when parents wanted assistance from their offsprings to support the family.

These people naturally rent an apartment. There are certain advantages to living in a rented apartment. First of all, the person does not have to pay a huge sum of money at a time and does not need to pay housing taxes and bear the costs of maintenance. Moreover, such people can change the living place based on the location of their workplace and children\u2019s school. The renovation of the apartment is the landlord\u2019s responsibility and the tenants do not need to worry about it.\n\nOn the contrary, owning a house gives a sense of personal achievement that tenants cannot enjoy. A house is a permanent asset and with time its price increases. The landlord can rent the house and this can be a steady source of earning for him. Furthermore, being the owner of a house means there is no one over the shoulder to watch what someone is doing and no sudden notice for evacuation. For instance, we had to vacate our apartment all of a sudden at least thrice until we purchased our own house a decade earlier. This is some sort of freedom that only house owners enjoy. Besides, the owner can construct and design the house the way he likes and enjoy open space, garden, and other facilities in the house.\n\nTo conclude, renting a flat has some benefits but the overall freedom and monetary compensations house owners enjoy are far significant, and this is why every tenant dreams to own a house someday.", "original_link": "https://www.ielts-mentor.com/writing-sample/writing-task-2/2853-does-renting-a-house-have-more-advantages-or-disadvantages"}, {"essay_topic": "In some schools and universities, girls tend to choose arts subjects (e.g. literature), and boys tend to choose science subjects (e.g. physics). Why do you think this is so? Should this tendency be changed?", "extra_topic": "", "model_answer": "\nAccording to the traditional belief, men are the breadwinners while females are caregivers and responsible for taking care of the family. This belief, along with some old-fashioned views like boys are good at mathematics while females are not, is the primary reason for many parents to encourage their sons to study science while daughters art-related subjects. I wholeheartedly believe that this trend should change.\n\nTo begin with, it is generally believed that boys are good at science-related subjects. This view is rooted so deep in our society that many females have already accepted it. This is more prevalent in developing countries where parents expect their sons to have a career while daughters become moderately educated and finally get married and have a family. Strangely, studying in science majors require more money in most countries, and this is why parents naturally select their boys to study science. Females, on the other hand, need to take many responsibilities of the family even during their student life and prefer to have subjects that do not require a great deal of study, as they consider it.\n\nMen and women have similar capacities and hidden potentials. Given the equal opportunity, many women would excel in science-related subjects. Great scientists like Marie Curie, Ada Lovelace, and Emilie du Chatelet have proved that women are no less capable than men when it comes to science. The heinous trend of gender discrimination, even in the education sector, should stop. The good news is that women in many engineering and technology subjects are already occupying half of the seats in many prestigious universities. Thus the day is not far away when the social custom or emotional aversion of parents would accept that their daughters are just as talented as their sons are in any area, including science.\n\nTo conclude, women empowerment is quite an essential factor for the overall development of a nation, and that is why females should get a fair chance to participate in any subjects, including science majors, in schools and universities.

Since many young people become parents and the number of nuclear families is on the rise, many experts emphasize the importance of parenting courses for both fathers and mothers. I personally agree with this notion as I believe that such sessions would be immensely helpful.\n\nTo begin with, proper parenting requires a great deal of knowledge and dedication. Sometimes minor negligence and lack of knowledge can lead to catastrophic outcomes. For instance, if busy parents forget to vaccinate a newborn, that would jeopardize the offspring\u2019s life. Similarly, many parents believe in silly superstitions that influence them to make bad choices. If those parents attend a course where experts share their opinions on different aspects of child fostering and proper parenting, they would be highly benefitted. For example, my cousin Paula, who became a mother a few months ago believed that her child had a problem with digestion and need medical attention. However, it was revealed that the way she fed her daughter was not correct. I believe that a suitable course that brings out different aspects of upbringing a child, both moral and practical aspects, would prove out to be important for newly become parents.\n\nMoreover, the increasing trends of single parents and nuclear family lack the expert opinion of the grandparents, unlike in the past. This is why the need for such parenting sessions has risen even more. Such sessions bring parents together, let them share their views, forms a social relationship and help people learn the real facts about their personal prejudices. This is a great way to educate the \"to-be-parents\", and \"newly-become-parents\" to learn more about the practical aspects of parenting. It also makes a better society, in a broader sense.\n\nTo conclude, being informed and educated parents is an important aspect to become good parents. Since parenting courses help people in a diverse way, it is indeed a good idea for people to participate in such courses.Sample Answer 2: (Disagreement)\nRaising a child is considered a beautiful experience by parents and newly become parents often find it difficult. Though some parents feel that training classes on parenting will help them nurture their child properly, I believe otherwise. This essay will argue why it is unnecessary to undergo parenting training sessions in order to nurture one\u2019s child.\n\nIn today\u2019s fast-growing world, parents believe that coaching on parenting and professional advice will help them responsibly raise their child. The reason parents feel the need for such courses is mainly because of the busy lifestyle and the growth of nuclear families. They neither not talk to their parents and get advice, nor are they confident enough in their ability to look after their child. For instance, in India, certain institutions provide full-time classes on parenting and their demand is increasing. Distance from other senior members of the family is the main reason so many parents turn to such institutions.\n\nHowever, being a parent is a natural and wonderful experience that does not require any training. As soon as a couple enters the phase of parenting, the ability to raise their child is naturally born in them. It\u2019s just the confidence that is required and rest is attained gradually. Parenting needs are not the same for all and thus a predefined course is insufficient for many couples.\n\nTo conclude, the parenting ability is naturally inbuilt in every individual and one has to just figure that out in order to raise their child and this has to attain through expertise, not from theoretical courses.\n\n[Authtored by - Kanika]", "original_link": "https://www.ielts-mentor.com/writing-sample/writing-task-2/2851-it-is-necessary-for-parents-to-attend-a-parenting-training-course"}, {"essay_topic": "Some people think that instead of preventing climate change, we need to find a way to live with it.", "extra_topic": "", "model_answer": " [Disagreement]Perhaps the greatest threat to the world is not the atomic bombs, the regional conflicts, terrorism, an outbreak of population or political instability but the climate change and environmental degradation.

We have already harmed the environment to a great extent and the time has come for all nations to work together to reduce the environmental damage. The sudden flood in the USA, intense storm in Asia, unpredictable droughts in Africa are all resulting from climate change and this change is occurring rapidly than ever before.

There is a lot to do and we should start implementing regional cooperation right now. Every individual should contribute by emitting fewer fumes and planting as many trees as possible while the use of fossil fuel should be globally prohibited.

From this perspective, imposing job-related subjects is like killing the inner soul of the future generation. Finally, if schools can bring diversity among students and inform them about different perspectives of life, the students would themselves choose their career and transcend in future. So there is no need to create a robotic generation with a particular skill only.\n\nArts and history are as much important as any science and technical subjects are. The study of history empowers us to be prepared for the future and learn from our past mistakes. Similarly, arts and other traditional subjects allow us to learn to appreciate life. We revere Van Gauge and Leonardo da Vinci as much as we admire Sir Isaac Newton and Einstein. The world needs great artists and historians no less than it needs scientists and technicians.\n\nTo conclude, schools should equally focus on traditional subjects and skill-oriented subjects and nurture students\u2019 hidden potential to prepare the future generation to become leaders, not corporate slaves.

An increasing number of people also study abroad and live in a cross-cultural environment. This has broken their outdated social belief to a great extent, and they have a broader perspective of life and marriage. Moreover, young people have greater freedoms in choosing their life partners unlike in the past when parents primarily picked a bride or bridegroom for someone. Modern society also seems to have accepted this freedom and welcome marriage beyond the known boundary.\n\nCross-cultural marriage has several benefits. People have different inherent features and strength based on their culture, race, geographic location and family and it is often noticed that children of such cross-cultural couples are stronger and have diverse capabilities. Two people from totally different cultures, when get married, take time to understand each other and this often strengthens their conjugal relationship. They learn about other\u2019s tradition, culture, belief, language and this opens up an entirely new world for them.

Though trains can improve the city transport facilities, it is not an alternative to the existing road transports.

Social discriminations in city areas are far higher than in the other parts of the country.\n\nMoreover, people in small towns and villages have an exceptional connection and they know each other very well, which is quite the opposite in a city. Moreover, municipal life is full of competition and it makes people\u2019s life miserable. Someone has to compete to get in a public car, wait for his turn to meet the doctor, wait several hours in the traffic jam and fight hard to get a decent job. The competition is so high that even a child has to go through a tough fight to be accepted into a school.   \n\nI believe there are many steps that a government can take to tackle these issues. Firstly, the government should control the prices of the daily commodities and build more high rising buildings to reduce the house rent. More public buses with better facilities should be introduced to reduce traffic jam. Decentralisation and the development of the provincial towns would let the authorities shift many industries to these regions and thus reduce the pressure on the cities and metropolitan areas.\n\nIn conclusion, the government should take initiatives to improve people's living standard in cities and make sure rural areas and towns have plenty of job opportunities to reduce the pressure on big cities.", "original_link": "https://www.ielts-mentor.com/writing-sample/writing-task-2/2648-some-of-the-difficulties-of-living-in-a-city"}, {"essay_topic": "Some people claim that not enough of the waste from homes is recycled. They say that the only way to increase recycling is for governments to make it a legal requirement.", "extra_topic": "To what extent do you think laws are needed to make people recycle more of their waste?", "model_answer": " (Opinion: Waste recycling should be made mandatory for all)\nWaste recycling is a widely discussed issue around the globe, but even after numerous global initiatives and continuous announcements, people seem to react whimsically to this. Many opine that people tend to abide by something only when there are rules and legal obligations. This is why waste recycling should be made a law and mandatory to adhere to, in my opinion.\n\nTo begin with, waste recycling help save the environment and the process reuses many valuable materials. Some household garbage contains detrimental ingredients and can cause harm to the environment. If every homeowner takes the responsibility to participate in waste recycling, waste management as well as preserving a green environment would become easier. However, this is not the case and many people still ignore this. Thus comes the question of whether making it a law would force people to participate more and save the environment. I strongly believe this will.\n\nNaturally, people have a tendency to ignore many important tasks - be it for themselves or society as a whole. They are sometimes as careless as crossing the busy streets instead of taking the overpass or underpass, though the latter one is safer. On the contrary, when legal obligations and punishment for an act are in place, the number of participants seems like increases dramatically. For instance, when crossing busy streets instead of using the underpass in some cities have been made a legal offence, the number of road accidents decreased significantly over time. Similarly, when the government would make recycling mandatory by imposing laws, people would participate more in this. This is so sensitive an issue that this should have already been a part of the law.\n\nIn fact, the main objective of the law is to deter people from doing something bad and punish offenders to maintain a peaceful society. Since waste recycling is directly related to our environment and the well-being of our future generation, we should make it a legal responsibility so that people do not ignore this important task.\n\nIn conclusion, law and rules exist to encourage and somewhat force people to follow the good trends and avoid bad practices. Since people are not spontaneously participating in waste recycling and the amount of garbage they produce is increasing, the government must have defined rules and legislation to control it for the benefit of all.", "original_link": "https://www.ielts-mentor.com/writing-sample/writing-task-2/2645-only-way-to-increase-recycling-is-to-make-it-legal-requirement"}, {"essay_topic": "At the present time, the population of some countries includes a relatively large number of young adults, compared with the number of older people.", "extra_topic": "Do the advantages of this situation outweigh its disadvantages?", "model_answer": "\nThe proportion of elderly people in some countries, like Japan, is considerably higher while in some other regions, including some Asian and Western countries, young people comprise the highest percentage of the total population. Having a larger proportion of youth is considered to have more advantages for a country, and I think that a country should have more active youths for faster development.\n\nTo begin with, the young generation is dynamic, energetic, and can contribute to the job sector which has a huge positive impact on the economic development of the country. They come with fresh ideas and are free from old superstitions and traditional beliefs. It gives them a competitive advantage. The educated young generation is the best resource a country can have, and their contribution to the country is significantly higher than the participation of children and elder people. The contribution of the older people, however, could not be denied and they have already done their part for reforming the country. They have vast experience and wisdom that are vital for decision making. They are often considered a better fit for the decision-making positions.\n\nMoreover, children are the future of a country, and the elderly have already played their roles. On the contrary, the young generation is the active workforce and can lead to the overall growth of the country. They are active citizens in society while children and senior peoples are dependent on others. The young generation can learn things faster and can share ideas, and this is why they are better leaders. The ICT sector, for instance, is full of fresh minds and is globally led by young minds. The ICT sector is considered to be the most prominent sector for the development of a country, especially in this technological era, and it highlights the importance of young and fresh minds over elder people in a country.\n\nTo conclude, older people should not be considered a burden for the country, however, the young have more to contribute to society and the country as a whole.

Many Asian and European countries had plenty of fish species, but these days many fish species have become numbered. Overall, this has terrible impacts. Without imposing strict laws to stop uncontrolled fishing, while also investing money in improving the natural habitats of fishes, we will bear great losses.\n\nFishes, in many parts of the world, are caught early and they do not get time to grow and reproduce. Without the government\u2019s initiatives and proper policy, the condition will deteriorate as the greedy fishers would not spare any fish from their nets. As a consequence, marine life would lose its balance and many fish species would get extinct. To prevent it, the government must have strong surveillance to stop catching baby fishes.\n\nAs a direct result of over-fishing, many popular fish species have become very expensive and rare. For instance, Hilsha, the national fish of Bangladesh, is facing an acute threat of over-fishing and have become numbered. This has a negative economic impact as the country used to export this fish to many western countries. Besides, due to the exhaustive and indiscriminating fishing, many rivers, lakes and canals are void of fishes and more fishermen are finding it hard to live by fishing. Many governments have already taken steps by declaring many rivers, sea areas and canals restricted and marking commercial fishing prohibited in certain seasons, and this is making the livelihood of many fishermen even harder.\n\nIn conclusion, over-fishing must be stopped now and the government must decide to bring changes to save fish species.

The buzzword globalisation refers to the freeing up of markets, free flow of goods and information and as a result, the traditional barriers among nations are gradually breaking down and the world is becoming closer in terms of cultural and economic relations. So, I believe that, as a natural process, the culture of different countries are blending together and a country is adopting foreign cultures faster than ever.\n\nThese days some countries are experiencing rapid cultural changes and the culture of a dominating country is being adopted by the people of other countries. For instance, due to the spread of Indian TV channels and their Bombay-centric flamboyant Hindi cultures, many SAARC countries are on the verge of losing their century-old cultural uniqueness in the films and fashion industries. Interestingly, Indian culture is also being influenced by more dominating Hollywood.\n\nMoreover, in the age of globalisation, countries are seeking greater cooperation and the spirit is a greater flow of commodities, information and people across the borders of different countries. Mass media and technology have played an even greater role in promoting the norm of globalisation and people these days are aware of the cultural presence of other countries. The tourist influx in different countries is creating a mixed cultural global village where no country is unique, rather they all have a mixed culture.\n\nSome people treat this as a natural process while others take it as a threat to their own cultural identity. I believe that cultures are dynamic and living phenomena. Culture, what we know today, was different in the past and that is why we should not be too much wary of changes. Even before globalisation swept in, we started celebrating the 31st December and Valentine\u2019s Day, which is completely foreign to our culture. This is the era of free information exchange and if we stop international cooperation for the sake of our cultural identity, our progress would stop overnight.\n\nIn conclusion, free trade and the global market is such a powerful concept that it cannot be stopped anymore.

With the span of time, many environmental problems are becoming global issues, and I believe that global initiatives will bring the best result. It will also make the world a better place to live in.\n\nTo begin with, environmental problems are generally caused by humans and while some of them are national in nature, most of them are global issues. Noise or water pollution at a time remain national problems but after a certain period, it would turn into a problem for the whole world. Thus if some environmental problems are left unaddressed due to its span in a country, it would soon become a problem for all nations.\n\nMoreover, not all nations are equally qualified to address issues of such magnitude due to their economic and political aspects and this is why other affluent nations should extend their helping hands to solve such problems. Rich nations cause more global warming and this is why they need to build a common platform to bring all nations together to fight environmental problems. For a poor country, it is quite tough to allocate a budget for saving the greenery while millions of its population are suffering from hunger and natural disaster. This is why other rich nations have natural obligations to help those poor or developing nations.\n \nTo draw the conclusion, global environmental problems like greenhouse effects, global warming etc. have already become a concern for every nation. A collaborative effort to address these problems would be a better strategy as each nation is not equally adept to solve global problems.Model Answer 2: (Environmental problems should sometimes be addressed globally and sometimes regionally based on their types.)\nEnvironmental problems greatly vary in terms of their magnitudes, and some of these are local, while others are definitely global in nature - the greenhouse effect or global warming for example. For the best result, these sort of problems should be addressed at the most appropriate levels, sometimes even at multiple levels.\n\nTo begin with, some environmental problems are generally caused by a group of people in a particular region and these issues get accelerated by the rapid expansion of industrialisation in this region. These sorts of problems often include noise pollution, air pollution, deforestation, intoxicating waste disposal etc. and these are generally national in nature. It is better to address these types of environmental problems at the national level and educating people is a viable solution in this scenario. International aid sometimes can help a poor or developing country to address environmental problems but the government of the country should take initiatives to solve such national problems.\n\nHaving said that, some environmental problems, for instance, common river, coastline or sea pollution concerns more than one countries and those sorts of problems should be addressed at a bilateral level. Similarly, if an environmental problem concerns a large region, for instance, a continent, that should be discussed and fought by the countries that are located on this continent. Some common examples of this type of environmental problems are desertification, soil erosion, aridness and floods.  \n\nFinally, some environmental problems pervade across national boundaries and calls for multinational or global collaboration. For example, radioactive industrial wastages in oceans, ozone layer degradation, global warming are global issues and these types of problems should be addressed by every single nation in the world. For greater success and effectiveness, I believe that the commitment of countries, especially rich nations, is quite important.\n\nTo conclude, environmental problems should be viewed as a common problem for mankind and those global problems should be endorsed and shared globally by all nations. Similarly, rich nationals should help developing nations to fight their regional and national environmental problems for the best result.", "original_link": "https://www.ielts-mentor.com/writing-sample/writing-task-2/2618-environmental-problems-are-becoming-a-global-issue"}, {"essay_topic": "Subjects such as Art, Sport and Music are being dropped from the school curriculum for subjects such as Information Technology.

Whether old subjects should be replaced by modern ones is a matter of great debate. I believe it is a difficult question to answer, and different schools should adopt different solutions.\n\nSome believe that traditional subjects should be retained as part of the school curriculum as they have great values for the students. According to them, school education is not merely a process to ensure a future job. This is rather a broader aspect, and to build an enlightened future generation, we need more cultural and arts-related subjects than technical ones. Another group of people believe that technical subjects are more important than arts and sports-related subjects as they not only ensure better learning for students but guarantee jobs in the future also. From a more practical point of view, technical knowledge is more important in life, and this is why many people and guardians support the change in the school curriculum.\n\nI personally believe that the school curriculum should be changed from time to time to make it more suitable for the latest trend. This, however, does not mean that we drop cultural and art-related subjects from our school.

Though this trend has some benefits as it widens our freedom as consumers, it has some severe disadvantages which makes it a dangerous trend.\n\nWe live in a global village, and with the introduction of the speedy transportation system, food grown anywhere could be transported to other parts of the world. It ensures that people can buy many types of local and foreign fruits, vegetables and other food items from the nearby markets. \"If something is not locally grown, import it\" - globalisation has made it a reality. It also fosters international trade, helps many farmers reach the international market and help countries fight their food scarcity. However, this does not come without a price.\n\nThe transportation of food requires burning more fuel, and this is detrimental to the environment. Just to supply internationally grown fruits, we are degrading our environment. This is a price we cannot afford to pay. Another negative impact of transporting food is putting the local farmers into the competition, and they are forced to produce more items at a lower cost and hence the increasing use of chemicals. This, in a way, is declining the quality of locally grown food items.\n\nFurthermore, consumers are often forced to purchase imported food that was preserved and produced with the use of chemicals and preservatives.

Many young talents are wasted and families destroyed due to drug abuse. Not only the illegal drugs are being misused, but also the youth's experiment with illegal substances are on the rise. Suggesting accurate remedies for that problem requires a clear understanding of the underlying reasons and this essay will attempt it.\n\nTo note down the possible reasons for youth drug abuse, we need to consider the availability of these drugs and many corrupted law officers first. According to several news reports and investigations, the law-enforcing department has a list of all drug dealers and possible spots where illegal drugs are sold. If this is the case, why they are yet to wipe out the illegal drug business from the city is a big question! No doubt, money and corruption play a role here. Besides, some people say that family bonding in modern life is not as close as it used to be. Due to family issues and pressure, many young people start abusing drugs. Initially, they find it a relief but soon get trapped. Thirdly, the lack of proper counselling and teenagers curiosity drive many of them to try new drugs. Bad companies who are on drugs can influence many youths to start it. Finally, public advertisements, magazines and movies that depict smoking and drinking positively can attract young minds. They often try to mimic their favourite actors and this is just the beginning that ends in substance-abusing.\n\nPersonally, I would like to suggest that the authority should try to wipe out the illegal drug businesses from the country. If the illegal drug business is closed, teenagers would not be curious to try them. Another way to tackle this issue is by having better family bonding and parents spending quality time with their children. Finally, all sorts of public advertisement for tobacco or alcohol should be completely banned.\n\nTo conclude, hopefully, the day not far away when we will have no young drug abuser in our society and this can be achieved by us - as a parent, as a teacher, as a friend and finally as a law-enforcing officer.

While many disciples choose university halls, others opt to live in an apartment, and it has both benefits and demerits. This essay examines both advantages and disadvantages of living in a separate apartment than living in a university residence. Personally, I would prefer to live in a university residence.\n\nLiving in an apartment offers many distinct advantages, and privacy is one of them. While a student in a dormitory has little privacy, someone in an apartment enjoys far better privacy and freedom. Learners who live in an independent house can choose a quiet neighbourhood, and this environment is conducive for studying attentively. Furthermore, living in an apartment makes students more independent, and they can choose a better diet. For instance, one of my cousins moved to an apartment after living in a university dormitory for about six months, and he did so because he hated the food offered in his university canteen.\n\nHaving said that, living in an apartment rather than a university dormitory has some visible disadvantages. First and foremost is the cost. In my country, living in an apartment is quite expensive while the university offers cheap accommodation. The food is also cheaper in the university dining halls. Second, renting an apartment in my city is hard for a student. The landlords prefer families over the students. Furthermore, the daily commuting is convenient from the university halls while not so easy from the apartments away from the university campus.

Poverty, corruption, pollution and diseases are epidemic in these parts of the world and the higher populace is the main reason for it. If the population in these two continents are not controlled, the problems would completely get out of hand and this essay suggests some ways of curbing the expansion of the population.\n \nThe terribly higher population density, poverty, unemployment and other social problems have already made it tough for Asian and African countries to progress and the increasing population growth makes the future even more uncertain there. Higher population in some developed countries are seen as a blessing while it is not the case in most of the Asian and African countries as most of their citizens are uneducated and unskilled.\n\nTo control the population, the first step has to come from the government. The authority should restrict the number of children a family can have, and violation of this policy should be severely punished. Countries like China have already adopted this policy and have been able to control their population to a certain extent. Besides, the citizens have to realise the negative effects of the uncontrolled population and spontaneously take birth control measures. Without the support of the ordinary population, the government alone cannot control it. Above all, international organisations like WHO, UNDP and other humanitarian organisation should work in these countries to educate people about the negative consequences of the higher population growth. Besides, they should provide funds for birth control in these countries.\n\nIn conclusion, the higher population in poor countries is a big threat, and, oftentimes, the main hindrance to true progress. The government, ordinary people and international organisations should work together to control the rapid population growth in these countries. Without a combination of policy, awareness and a free flow of funds, it would be impossible to help those countries control their population.Model Answer 2:\nThe population growth in the world has already gone out of control, and it is more daunting in most Asian and African countries. The population growth in these regions is uncontrollable due to ignorance, poor quality of life, and the religious and social taboo against population control. In this essay, I will briefly suggest some issues that overpopulation causes, and then suggest some ways to control it.\n\nOverpopulation causes a complex set of problems that negatively affects the quality of life. It also increases crime, pollution and corruption. Increasing population creates more pressure on the already limited resources in the poor and developing countries and an upsurge in population will simply make the situation worse. Unemployment, inadequate infrastructure, poverty, malnutrition, low literacy rates and high competition already make the citizens suffer a lot, and if the population growth is not controlled, it will make things worse day by day.\n\nControlling the population in a country can not be achieved overnight, and despite initiatives and educational campaigns, the result might come at a slow pace. However, proper steps should be taken to control the rapid expansion of the population. First, the authority should take initiatives and launch awareness campaigns more frequently, especially among the poor citizens, to educate them about the negative consequences of having many children. Making contraceptives available for free among the poor population should be ensured. Finally, the government must impose laws to restrict the number of children a family can have. For instance, families in China are not allowed to have more than one child, and any violation of it incites financial penalty. This may seem cruel at first but the one-child policy has already given positive outcomes to many populous countries.\n\nIn conclusion, if the population keeps increasing at the current rate, the world would soon find itself in the verse of war for food, shelter and medicine.

However,  agriculture alone cannot enlist a country as an advanced nation in this modern era. The industrial revolution has taught us that manual labour and agricultural products cannot singly improve the economic condition of a nation. And a country must have an export-oriented industry or great industrial hub to progress quickly. For instance, a poor country has to export several hundreds of tonnes of grains to import only a few numbers of modern machinery. This disparity will keep on enhancing if the nation cannot become industrially sufficient. Asian economy has already shifted from farming and fishing to industrialisation and no developing country can further progress without following the same pathway, as the research suggests.\n\nWhile agricultural development should not be ignored, especially in countries like Bangladesh, industrialisation should get more priority. Diversifying the agricultural products and exports is a great power for an agricultural-based country, but this takes a long way to reach the top and with the revolution and rapid expansion of the industrial world, this has become quite challenging, in a practical world.\n\nTo conclude, an agriculture-dependent country like Bangladesh should try to diversify its agricultural sector to become self-sufficient in its food supply but must have a long-term industrial strategy to progress and become a developed nation.", "original_link": "https://www.ielts-mentor.com/writing-sample/writing-task-2/2612-developing-countries-should-concentrate-more-on-industrial-development"}, {"essay_topic": "During the last twenty years, the assessment of students has undergone a major transformation.

However, a more suitable and modern approach has been adopted by many schools, and this is often regarded as a better technique to evaluate a pupil\u2019s learning ability and knowledge. I personally believe that the innovative modern assessment technique is more suitable.\n\nTo begin with, the conventional exam system has a major flaw which is its inadequacy to evaluate the true knowledge of pupils. For instance, in the conventional paper-based exam system, students can memorise answers to a few questions and pass the exam with a good grade. Someone with little knowledge of a subject can get a higher grade by memorising answers. On the contrary, innovative approaches like group assignments, sudden quiz, hands-on tests etc. can reflect the actual level of student\u2019s learning. This is why many educational institutions are shifting towards these assessment techniques from the traditional exam system and I really believe that this will, in the future, become the main evaluation technique in schools.\n\nMoreover, the paper-based exam system allows students to cheat the exam and pass it without even studying hard. On the contrary, a student would not be able to pass a hands-on test or an open-book exam where he needs to propose a solution to a problem rather than writing answers from books. From my experience, I can tell that I had to study more to pass the sudden class tests than my term-finals as I had no clue what teachers would assess on these sudden tests. Many schools have already introduced a few innovative assessment techniques due to their experience from the traditional tests and their limitations. The latest methods are in place because they are more suitable.\n\nTo conclude, the right technique to evaluate students is an important issue, and no stone should be unturned to introduce the most effective way of doing it.

As an immediate solution, many express their view that rich countries should allow more evacuees to enter their border to reduce the severity of this crisis. However, accepting a higher number of migrants by the developed countries is not a viable solution to this refugee crisis, in my opinion.\n\nTo begin with, worldwide refugees and their constant sufferings are often reported on TV. It might seem that industrialised countries can easily solve this emergency and miseries by allowing more refugees to enter their countries. In reality, this is certainly not an easy solution. If we only look at the few recent catastrophic events that the migrant refugees have caused, it would become clear why the governments in developed countries are unwavering to accept more people to their countries. Besides, historically, it is evident that only granting more refugees in other countries does not solve the problem, in some cases, it deteriorates it.\n\nIt is true that, due to humanitarian reasons, some developed countries should help destitute and needy people. This is partly a moral issue and partly because it is in the self-economic interest of the industrialised countries. Considering this, a practical way of reducing the severity of this crisis would be to accept more refugees, particularly when it is caused by a natural disaster and civil war.\n\nBut, from a more practical point of view, mass immigrations would bring more negative effects. Solving the root cause of the outbreaks of refugees is a far better way than allowing them freely migrate to developed countries. On a practical level, homeless refugees are sometimes better off receiving aid in their homeland than suffering racism and begging on the streets in a country where they cannot speak the language.\n\nTo conclude, rich countries should take refugees but only in extreme cases and should focus on solving the primary reason behind the refugee issue.

This is why the influx of people in cities is ever-increasing and young people mostly move to cities, away from their families, to pursue a better education and to have a job. Though there are many advantages to this trend, negative sides are also there.\n\nTo commence with, the young generation has to move to cities to get admitted into better colleges or universities. Evidently, cities have more specialised universities while rural areas scarcely have such facilities. This is why parents want their children to study in a college in a city rather than in a village. Moreover, jobs, business opportunities, living standard, health care and technological advancements often bound educated young to move to urban areas. For instance, an IT professional has almost no chances of having a job in a remote area while there are plenty of opportunities for this person in a city.  \n\nI believe that there are more advantages to this trend, though the negative consequences should also be considered. First of all, only a handful of youth would be able to start a career in villages and most of them would eventually be forced to move. This is because the opportunity and facilities in cities are much wider. Unless the government creates new job opportunities for the educated young generation in rural areas, forcing them to stay there would be a terrible idea. On the contrary, if everyone moves to the cities, the rural areas will always remain underdeveloped and would lack talented entrepreneurs. This would also increase the population density and pollutions in metro areas.\n\nIn conclusion, some professionals, like doctors should be encouraged to work in rural areas while professionals like software developers should stay in the city.

I believe that pursuing a gap year can provide worthwhile experiences to juveniles, laying the seeds of a prosperous professional career.\n\nOn the one hand, by taking a gap year, youngsters can gain relevant work experiences and key skills which help broaden their view of the world. Working during the defer years can increase their knowledge and communication skills. Furthermore, experiencing the customs and cultures of other countries help gain appreciation and awareness of global issues, which put them in leadership positions.

To add to the ordeal, one can get into debt. One in ten people faces financial ordeals from budget mismanagement according to gap-year tour operators. In my view, that number is negligible.\n\nFinally, in my opinion, hefty expenses should be the least cause for deterring a gap year. The return on investment is high, bringing positive drastic changes to the personality of the youngster. Travelling to other countries solidifies young adults with soft, and hard skills; moulding character and individuality. Facing and circumventing adversity in an unfamiliar country sets a solid foundation for solving problems in life.

Also, information is instantaneously available, at the behest of the people due to this technology. From a historical perspective, the comfort level enjoyed by people is at its pinnacle. Such is the impact of the internet on our life. This essay will discuss how the internet is playing an indispensable role in shaping education as one of the main advantages, and, secondly, outline how cybercrimes can adversely affect lives.\n\nThe internet significantly boosts student autonomy. Students have the freedom to focus on whatever topics or subjects they want to study and learn more on this subject. An example is the number of online courses available, covering a variety of subjects, which up until today was unavailable to most learners. This has caused an upsurge in the number of people studying tertiary-level degrees, at a pace and schedule that suits them the best. Education is no more a rigid process of learning in classrooms, rather, it is an entertaining, engaging and fun activity and thanks to the internet technology for that.\n\nThe main disadvantage associated with the usage of the internet is the rise of electronic crimes. People risk their privacy online by having their sensitive information stolen by malicious software written by nefarious hackers. According to Time Magazine, the shopping giant Walmart suffered one of the largest online heists ever, where a security breach leaked millions of credit card information. This resulted in disrupting their shopping services; affecting customers living in remote areas.\n\nIn conclusion, the benefits the internet bring to education, such as student autonomy, must be measured against the drawbacks, such as cybercrimes.

What are the reasons for this, and how could the problem be solved?", "extra_topic": "", "model_answer": "\nRecently, in many countries, there has been a steady decline in the number of people willing to become teachers, especially in secondary schools. This essay will look at the reasons for this downfall and propose some solutions.\n\nOne of the main problems contributing to the lack of interest in pursuing a career in teaching is lower remuneration. In other words, salaries earned by teachers are lower compared to other professions. For example, a school teacher in Bangladesh earns a salary of 10,000 takas compared to other professions where the salary is at least 25,000 taka. Raising the minimum wage of teachers will significantly encourage people to take up teaching as a profession.\n\nAnother cause that magnifies the problem is the difficult behaviours exhibited by secondary level students. That is to say, adolescents, these days behave indecently by showing brash attitudes towards teachers. Such misbehaviour and misdemeanours do little to motivate a teacher to pursue the profession in a high school. According to Psychology Today, 60 per cent of the teachers feel indignant and dejected while teaching high school students. Which causes current teachers to quit and un-appeals prospective teachers. Rectifying students behaviours will encourage more employees to pursue the teaching profession.\n\nThe final cause is the amount is workload; both on and off school hours. To elaborate, teachers often have to sacrifice their personal time to check student copies, exam papers at home. Doing so does not allow a teacher to rest and recover from stress, which is hazardous to both the psychological and physical well-being of the teacher. This eventually causes the burnout effect, where the mind and body cease to function properly. An ideal solution to kerb such an effect is to improvise work-life balance by the respective school authorities. This will attract more people to this profession.\n\nIn summary, lower remuneration disinterests teachers towards the profession which can be solved by increasing wages. Difficult behaviours by high school students demotivate the teacher causing them to quit or disinterest potential teachers, which can be solved by rectifying student behaviours. Overwork detriments the mental and physical well-being of teachers causing the burnout effect, which can be solved by improvising work-life balance by school authorities.\n\nIn conclusion, we need excellent teachers to build a better nation as their contribution as teachers are unparalleled.

While some people assert that the widespread use of internet communication and mobile phones will replace the traditional form of face to face interaction, I completely disagree with this view.\n\nTo begin with, the use of the internet and other latest communication technologies drive us to meet new people and contact the dear ones who stay far away. This can especially be true when one gets a chance to express his or her feelings via a text or phone call.

Quite often, tech developers announce innovative tech gadgets that are easy to use, handy, innovative, and life-saving.

Others, however, oppose this idea and opine that a university is a place to shape the overall ability of learners to create an enlightened nation. I agree with the latter view and believe that the way universities teach around the world is a far better setup than focusing only on job-centric education.\n\nFirst of all, in the modern world, the job sectors are dynamic and employees take on new challenges and work in diverse areas at their workplaces. Knowledge learned from the university subjects, only focused on careers, fails to enhance the overall skill of students. So, it can be catastrophic for a nation to have a workforce who have been taught job-related courses but were not introduced to the vast array of other aspects of education. Most of the companies, these days, search for people who are more dynamic and have diverse skills than candidates with good grades. For instance, most software development companies give priority to a candidate's performance, skill set and analytical ability than his academic results.\n\nSecondly, the competitive job sector all over the world forces many graduates to seek jobs in an entirely different sector than their majors in universities. Thus someone who graduated from IT is becoming a banker and someone from a finance background is working as an HR. Many also set up their own business instead of doing a job. It has all been possible due to a wide range of subjects that the universities have taught to those students.\n\nFurthermore, employees often need to enrol in different training and professional courses.

For instance, IT professionals often take the MBA course and this is another good example of why university students should study an extensive range of subjects rather than studying some particular subjects for the jobs.\n\nI, therefore, conclude that a wide range of subjects at the university level is more useful for a student's career and overall growth.

For example, available monetary resources, according to them, could be put to use in building more hospitals, roads, schools and developing other infrastructures. This means increasing care of the sick and improved transportation to previously inaccessible areas. For children, it caters for better education facilities. These people believe that art is a luxury and many governments cannot afford this extravagance.\n\nHowever, while investments in such areas are vital, spending on arts is equally important. Allocating money to the development and sustenance of arts helps boost the economy, and arts are important to alleviate crime from society and positively entertain and engage people. Art galleries can attract tourists from all over the world, generating revenue in return while artists can reveal discrimination of society through their works. It is also the case that viewing and practising arts, such as painting, music, acting, dancing and so on, are good sources of venting out stress while educating people at the same time.

However, I personally think that arts are an essential part of a culture, and it is quite fair to allocate funds to preserve and develop arts.\n\nAdmittedly, there are some justifications by people who oppose spending on promoting arts. First of all, most art projects are expensive with no obvious outcomes that have direct relations to a nation\u2019s income. For example, the monument of Kebangkitan Pahlawan in Malang city that adsorbed almost 1 billion rupiahs does not attract people that much. Besides, art is not a critical aspect of the sustainability of human\u2019s life. Human\u2019s life will not disappear just because they have less taste of aesthetic.\n\nHowever, I still support that the government should allocate a budget for the arts. Arts are part of a culture and over time become the identity of a nation, eventually, arts could be a major source of income for them. For instance, Bali is an island in Indonesia, where millions of visitors come each year to experience the combination of conventional values and modern lifestyles. The government in Indonesia invests more than a third of its budget to maintain its traditional arts.\n\nFurthermore, art makes a life worth living. Like food, art is a supplement for the human soul. It has a magnificent power to aid buildings, roads, parks, and everything, with its uniqueness. Just imagine how empty a room would be if there is no painting or decoration on the wall! Art is enhancing people\u2019s life by leveraging their experiences and empowering people to possess beautiful imagination.\n\nTo conclude, supporting arts is important for a government as it would enhance the quality of life either by improving the tourism industry or by providing a better artistic facility.\n\n[Written by - Happy Singh]", "original_link": "https://www.ielts-mentor.com/writing-sample/writing-task-2/2516-government-is-wasting-money-on-the-arts"}, {"essay_topic": "Due to the development and rapid expansion of supermarkets in some countries, many small, local businesses are unable to compete.

While people with both points of view continue to exist, I strongly believe that opening up shopping marts helps local communities to bloom and blossom.\n\nProponents of the idea argue that international products render local investors out of business. As increasing numbers of cheap goods are available to choose from, sufficient funds may not be available to local people to produce items of comparable quality and sell them at a cheap price. For example, ever since the advent of Chinese cotton and food industries, the native Pakistani cotton fabric industry has almost shut down. This has also resulted in many individuals being unemployed, also leaving local contractors paralysed.\n\nHowever, while such problems do occur, large shopping areas, in fact, help to sustain local produce. Firstly, as competitors stock their articles from around the world, inhabitants of the area stand a better chance to sell their crops and finished goods to a greater number of customers. Generation of an increased amount of revenue would be a direct consequence, therefore, enhancing the gross domestic product in return. Moreover, the establishment of supermarkets can help foster pride en masse. This can be especially true in cases where local items occupy shelves of supermarkets, enabling purchases by international customers. Provided marketing strategies are put to use, a brand might become popular all over the world, thereby setting the stage for uplifting morale.\n\nTo conclude, it is imperative that the growth and sustenance of supermarkets will fuel the survival of local communities and it is expected that more initiatives would be taken to expand supermarkets where local products are displayed and sold.[Written by - Sadaf Malik]", "original_link": "https://www.ielts-mentor.com/writing-sample/writing-task-2/2507-development-and-rapid-expansion-of-supermarkets"}, {"essay_topic": "Some people think paying taxes is a big enough contribution to their society, while others think people have more responsibilities as members of society than only paying taxes.", "extra_topic": "", "model_answer": " [View: All citizens have to abide by their social responsibilities while capable members must pay taxes.

However, others opine that paying taxes does not automatically spare citizens from other obligations and moral duties. This essay discusses both views, however, I believe that all citizens have to abide by their social responsibilities while capable members must pay taxes.\n\nOn the one hand, tax money helps the authority run the public service, pay salaries to government employees, take new development initiatives, fund research works, and offer subsidiaries to important sectors. So this money essentially helps run the country. Without the taxpayers' money, for example, the price of commodities will go up, no new roads would be built, education and medical treatment would be expensive. So it is understandable that a taxpayer is contributing to smoothly run the country and should be offered some benefits than non-taxpayers, and if required, they should be excused from other social responsibilities.\n \nOn the other hand, it is undeniable that taxpayers are also benefiting from the money they are paying and should not be released from their other duties. Just paying tax should not allow someone to be above the law. These taxpayers should follow rules and also act virtuously to keep society on track. Besides, they have moral duties to people around them due to their financial well-off status. For instance, the highest taxpayers in society are usually the most powerful and financially successful persons, and due to their social influences, they have even more responsibilities to help needy people and take initiatives to save the environment and make the area a better place to live in.\n\nIn conclusion, paying tax is important, but it does not automatically excuse them from obeying social rules, helping needy people and performing moral duties.

In my opinion, watching sports on television is not a waste of time, but, there should be a balance between the time spent on watching sports and taking part in other social and recreational activities.\n\nFirst of all, watching sports is an excellent form of entertainment, relaxation, and for many, this is even a passion to follow. Moreover, People watch sports with others, which is a great way of socialising and enhancing the relationship. In my country, for example, watching live sports on TV has become an event of socialising and communicating with each other. However, spending hours after hours in front of a TV set to watch different sports and not doing anything is not recommended.\n\nOn the contrary, many people claim that watching sporting events in free time every day is not a good habit or a healthy activity as this time could be better utilised by taking part in other social activities and skill development programmes. People, who watch TV most of the time, become isolated and develop unhealthy eating habit. Thus according to many, watching sports on TV has no significant benefits. They affirm that participating in outdoor activities are much healthier and advantageous.\n\nTo conclude, we have to maintain a balance in our leisure activities; while enjoying sports is a good way of relaxation and socialisation, too much of it can be harmful.

This essay will discuss both views, but, in my opinion, influences of parents, and family life are essential for the proper growth of a child, but environmental and external influences are more useful for them to confront life ad become successful.\n\nTo commence with, parents have extraordinary impacts on their children's growth, especially to shape a good childhood. The sense of family, relationship, responsibility, and punctuality are instilled in a child by parents and it plays an influential role in their maturity. Love and attention from parents develop a strong character in a child while the lack of proper parenting often ruins it, according to many psychologists. Furthermore, children mostly mimic their parents and become more like them. Undoubtedly, this single fact proves how important it is for a child to have a family and good parenting.\n\nConversely, to become successful and face life, we need to study in a school, interact with teachers and neighbours, have friends, face challenges, learn from our environment, gain social experiences, and all those factors have crucial roles to play in a child\u2019s life.

While some believe that both genders have an equal aptitude to do any sort of work, others, however, deny it. This essay delves into the issue and then draw a sensible conclusion.\n\nA group of people opine that men and women are not physically much different. Apart from that, men and women possess the same natural abilities, thinking patterns, emotions, needs and instincts. Since women are kept mostly inside houses, they react differently than men in different situations. If both men and women are given equal opportunity and experience, they can both handle any job with the same efficiency. Thus, this group of people deny that any particular gender is better prepared for a job than the opposite gender. For example, they say that in the past, women were deprived of education, job and other social activities, and because of that, the number of women in higher corporate positions was fewer than that of today's number.\n\nAnother group, however, remains strict to the fact that men and women have different physical and mental capacities and these capacities make them more suitable for different types of professions. For instance, a woman is a natural caregiver and hence nursing is a more suitable profession for her. On the contrary construction works, one example of such many professions is suitable for men.  \n\nIn conclusion, tasks for men and women are determined mostly by their natural abilities and this is a natural law. Denying it would not be a good idea and in my opinion, no task is less important and thus distinctive professions makes them perform better.Sample Answer 2:\nWhether natural aptitude should determine the kind of work both men and women should do or they are capable of doing the same type of work is somewhat controversial and require thorough discussion. This essay will explain both aspects. However, I believe that both genders are qualified to take the same challenge and are capable of doing similar jobs.\n\nFrom one perspective, women are generally considered physically weaker than men and hence less suitable for jobs that require ferocity and physical power. Men, on the other hand, are meant to provide and protect their wives and the entire family and earn the living. Secondly, the caring nature and tender heart that women possess make them more capable of certain careers. This means they generally perform better in occupations that require patience, caring and kind heart such as nursing, social works and teaching.\n\nFrom the opposite perspective, modern society does not discriminate against genders and offer any type of work to both male and female due to its fairness and advancements. Women and men who go to the same university and take the same training programmes are equally prepared to take a job. Again, the traditional idea that women will take care of their children while men will earn the living is changing and a reverse scenario could be seen in many families. Finally, women, in almost all fields, have already proved that they can perform as good as men if they are given the opportunity. So there is no way we can undermine their capability.\n\nIn conclusion, although being naturally endowed may be beneficial for both genders in some situations, it is not particularly needed at workplaces.

I believe media like television, radio, book, film, theatre and comics have different advantages and disadvantages of their own as they have subtle differences in the way they convey messages and communicate information. The discussion about the positive and negative aspects of three media- TV, radio and books, will be outlined in the following paragraphs, and in my opinion, books are the most effective media for communicating information.\n\nFirst of all, as a modern medium, television has become a part of human life. Information presented on TV is easy to absorb and they are both informative and entertaining. However, it can make people passive, as the viewers just sit and watch it. Besides, research shows that TV programmes are addictive and can be a huge waste of time for many.\n\nSecondly, radio has an important value in our lives when it comes to conveying important information. This tool is helpful for visually impaired people, and we can work and enjoy radio programmes simultaneously, unlike TV programmes. We can carry it with us everywhere we go as modern radios are pretty small and are integrated with devices like smartphones. In contrast, radio signals are sometimes weak and limited only in a specific area. Over time, this medium is losing its popularity due to its technological limitations.\n\nFinally, books share invaluable information and contain important facts and stories. Data collected from the past are stored in books and help research works. By reading books people can broaden their imagination, enhance their knowledge and learn new things. Books are so far the best medium for communicating information - from generation to generation and past to present, and are the base of our modern civilisation. I believe the book is the most effective medium so far and will remain so for many coming generations. Except for the time and patience it requires, it hardly has any disadvantages.\n\nIn conclusion, every medium for communicating information has some distinct advantages and demerits, but books are the most effective media that can enlighten our minds and convey knowledge from one generation to another.Sample Answer 2: (TV, Radio, and Comics)\nThese days, various types of media, such as books, film, theatre and so on are used for communicating useful information. This essay discusses the positive and negative aspects of television, radio and comics as media. In my opinion, radio is the most effective medium to communicate useful information.\n\nTo commence with, many people like television because they can both listen to the information and visually see the events. News programmes inform people about national and international events and documentaries are a great source of learning materials. Should there be a special event in the country, most people would turn their TVs on and that makes it an effective tool to deliver different messages to the people. However, television has its own weakness as it is not mobile and thus often fail to reach people who are not home.\n\nSome people like the radio because of its mobility and entertainment programmes. Although many people consider it as old fashioned, others still prefer listening to the radio for obtaining useful information. People listen to the news, weather updates, traffic updates, music, discussions and so on while they drive, and it makes radio quite useful. However, it is not useful to people who have some sort of hearing impairment.\n\nAlthough several people think that comics are mostly for children, many adults still like reading comics. As comic conveys messages in the form of stories and dialogues, it is an effective tool for delivering important messages to young people. Despite the positive side, comic books have some drawbacks. The cost of producing comics is high and not all adults like to read them.\n\nTo conclude, even though these media have both advantages and limitations, they are useful to people. The radio is the most beneficial tool to inform people and convey important messages because of its mobility. It is expected that these media would be used more effectively to help people learn and communicate important information with them.", "original_link": "https://www.ielts-mentor.com/writing-sample/writing-task-2/2499-state-which-media-you-consider-to-be-the-most-effective"}, {"essay_topic": "The widespread use of the Internet has brought many problems.

What solutions can you suggest?", "extra_topic": "", "model_answer": "\nThe Internet is a revolutionary technology and it has changed the way people work, interact with each other and interchange information. But the negative consequences of it can not be overlooked and these problems stem mostly from the overuse and over-reliance on this technology. In this essay, the main problems of Internet technology with possible solutions will be discussed.\n\nTo commence with the problems, widespread use of the Internet is related to new and innovative devices like smartphones and computers, and we replace those devices more frequently than ever. Thus we are creating a throwaway society and contributing to the production of more hazardous waste every day. Furthermore, social media, online games, chat rooms are contributing to digital addictions among many teenagers. Apathy, for instance, is one of the most severe consequences of overreliance on the Internet and that obstructs people from participating in social activities. Besides, people are becoming less active, both socially and physically, due to increased screen time. As a result, our health condition is deteriorating and our social life is in jeopardy. Finally, our privacy is hanging on an edge and our security is at risk due to our extensive dependency on the Internet.\n\nAfter investigating the causes of the problems, it will be easier to offer solutions. First, parents should encourage their children to take part in outdoor activities, and restrict their screen time. Second, we should buy new electronic devices only when this is absolutely necessary. Moreover, the use of the Internet in schools and workplaces should be monitored. The young generation should be encouraged to get involved in social activities and take charity works. Finally, we should make our Internet access more secure and follow the standard security protocol so that hackers and intruders cannot access and gain our personal information like password or credit card information.\n\nIn conclusion, even though our society is becoming more dependent on the Internet and that can bring severe negative results, we have the solutions to mitigate these problems and enjoy the good side this technology offers us.Sample Answer 2:\nMany people believe that the Internet is the reason for many severe problems in society despite its numerous benefits. This essay will discuss some major problems of Internet usages and some of the solutions to resolve them.\n\nFor several reasons, the worldwide use of the Internet is the root cause of several serious issues. Firstly, it provides access to many inappropriate contents to its users, including children. As a result, many teenagers are addicted to obscenity and violence which has impacted their psychological growth and academic performance. Secondly, it has diminished real-life communication between families, friends and relatives. With the existence of smartphones and tablets, social networking platforms and an active internet connection, people stay online for several hours a day. Consequently, they are less interested in having face-to-face conversations with others.\n\nTo resolve the first issue, parents should monitor children's online activities. They should check their children's devices and advise them about the serious effects of accessing unsuitable contents. Parents could also make a security setting for their home internet setting, whereas inappropriate websites will be blocked. As for the second issue, it requires the commitment of individuals and family members. For example, as parents need to lead by example, they should set examples by using gadgets for a certain period of time each day. Family members should be disallowed to bring their devices during mealtime, therefore there will be plenty of time for verbal interactions between them.\n\nIn conclusion, the Internet has indeed brought some serious issues for many communities despite the marvel it has brought for the world. To address those issues, we have to be more active and conscious, act as family and society member while also monitor our younger members online activities.", "original_link": "https://www.ielts-mentor.com/writing-sample/writing-task-2/2490-widespread-use-of-internet-has-brought-many-problems"}, {"essay_topic": "Many people believe that bicycle is a healthy and environmentally friendly mode of transport.

However, some effective measures could help encourage people in society to use it more widely.\n\nA few decades ago, the bicycle was one of the main transportations around the globe. But with the popularity of motorised vehicles, the use of cycles has decreased drastically. A bicycle, in the past, used to be considered more convenient than walking or using animal-driven transports. However, when automobiles were introduced, people switched to a faster mode of transport. Those vehicles can carry more goods at a time, and businesses embraced them without further delay. Moreover, the safety of cyclists is a grave issue when dedicated roads are not built for them. Finally, bicycles lost their appeal in many countries where people started to prioritise comfort over an active lifestyle.  \n\nHowever, some useful measures can encourage more people to use this eco-friendly and healthful transport on the road again. Firstly, governments should implement separate cycling lanes that would ensure the safety of cyclists. In addition to that, providing secure parking facilities will also encourage many to use cycles. Restriction on car ownership and increasing the price of fuel would further encourage many to use bicycle instead of driving cars. Finally, awareness campaigns to educate people about the health and environmental benefits of using bicycles could be a great step to motivate more people to use this transport daily.\n\nTo conclude, a government has a great role to play to motivate its citizens to use bicycles and this would guarantee a green environment and a healthy nation.

This essay elucidates the wagering of fans as one of the crucial ingredients for the conflicts and then connotes that setting heavy fines by authorities is a good solution.\n\nTo commence with, we need to consider reasons for people who love sports to behave such irrationally, especially when they watch live sports. This should be examined from different perspectives to fully understand the purposes of this attitude. Monetary incentives, however, could widely be indicated as one of the chief agents for this misconduct. To illustrate, globally many people are addicted to betting on their favourite sportsmen or teams, ranging from football matches to horse riding competitions. The stress of not succeeding in their bet and correspondingly losing a great deal of money leads to accusing violent treatment. These behaviours might occur in the forms of bothering or hurting other individuals or damaging public properties.\n\nConsidering the diverse angles of this social phenomenon, setting a bunch of penalties against the populace particularly in gambling acts concerning sports events somehow could result in a fewer brutal etiquette of sport competition followers. As evidence, in some countries like Iran, wagering on any incident is identified as an unruly action in terms of legal and religion alike. Moreover, heavy fines could be waiting for offenders attempting to bet on games and sports competitions.\n\nTo conclude, although the causes of violent behaviour in sports events are needed to be considered from a different angle, the financial losses stemming from losing wager can be suitably responsible for such manners.

Without proper education and a good health care system, no nation can sustain, let alone progress ahead. Considering its significance, some people express their opinion that it is the responsibility of the government to ensure quality education and health service to its citizens. I strongly agree with this viewpoint.\n\nTo commence with, according to the \u201cNational Sample\u201d survey of India in 2019, people had to spend more than 35 per cent of their wages on health care and schooling. In a developing country, it is quite hard for citizens to manage it all on their own, especially since education and treatment are getting expensive every year. So, these should be free as poor people cannot afford higher education and a good health care system. Moreover, if the government provides free education, the literacy rate will surely increase and the citizens would contribute far better to the overall development of the country. So, in this way, the economy of that country will flourish day by day.\n\nBesides, another recent survey in India shows that almost 38% of people die every year without proper treatment because they can not afford expensive medical service. Since healthy citizens are the pillar of a prosperous nation, the government should intervene and make efforts to ensure proper healthcare for all. This way the country would develop faster while citizens would not be deprived of their basic rights. For instance, many countries, that are now considered developed, has had free medical care for all citizens and that boosted up their national development over the last few decades.\n\nIn conclusion, if education and medical facility are provided by the government for free to its citizens, then a country will get more benefits from it. Education and healthy life are two basic needs of every citizen and a government is, in fact, formed to make sure no citizen is denied of their basic needs.Sample Answer 2: (Agree to a certain extent)\nSome people believe that a government should provide free education and health care to its residents. To a certain point, I would agree with the idea, but I also believe that citizens should take some responsibility for their children's education and treatment for the family.\n\nFor several reasons, many people believe that education and healthcare should be funded by the government and offered to the citizens without any cost. To begin with, most people fulfil their tax obligations, and they should get some benefits from the government in the form of free medication and education for their children. It is a fact that education is an essential factor for the development of a country. By providing free education to the residents it is hoped that more skilled and educated workers would be created for the country. These potential workers will definitely boost the country's economy in the future. So free education should be treated as an investment by the authority.\n\nOne of the reasons to oppose the idea is that free medical service makes some people irresponsible of their health condition. It is believed that expensive health care would force people to follow a strict lifestyle and quit bad habits. Besides, the private fund for education makes the schooling system more effective as guardians are more conscious of taking care of their children's learning. For instance, many private schools are doing better in developing countries than the state-funded schools and parents' active involvement made the difference.\n\nTo conclude, to a certain extent, I support that a government should provide free education and medication to its citizens.

When the elites get richer and the low-income people get poorer, crime, inequality and violence rate increases significantly. This issue could be a threat to the country's sovereignty and stability as there might be widespread protests and riots.

The gap is responsible to brings political instability and dissatisfaction among mass people.

Firstly, the authority should make proper regulations in terms of business practice and create more job opportunities. Any monopoly and nepotism in important sectors should not be allowed.

Others believe that they have greatly increased human potential. How could computers be considered a hindrance?", "extra_topic": "", "model_answer": "\nComputers are extensively used these days almost everywhere. This includes banks, offices, hospitals, homes, schools, research labs, retail shops, space stations and so on. People have different views about the benefits and drawbacks of computers while this essay examines how could computers be considered an impediment.\n\nTo commence with, using computers for long hours by children is counterproductive because overuse of it can make children addicted to digital games, less enthusiastic to socialise, lethargic and obese due to the lack of their physical activities. Moreover, many children often rely on calculators and computers for simple arithmetic operations, spelling and grammatical rules. This can lead to poor academic and career performance. For example, a recent study reveals that many high school students fail to do well in mathematics due to their over-reliance on computers and calculators in early childhood. Apart from that, the health hazards that overuse of computers causes cannot be overlooked. Computers can be the reason for weak eye-sight, back pain and severe headache for the users - according to the Medical Alliance for Public Health.\n\nBesides, hacking, spamming, and computer viruses are very common these days which can lead to fraud, data breaching and monetary loss. When someone's bank account, email, and blog are compromised, it can lead to disaster. Furthermore, online perpetrators can pretend to be someone that they are not and trap people to take unfair advantages. In addition to that, the national security of any country could be compromised due to the over-reliance on computers. For instance, \u201cGarry McKinnon\u201d who was accused in March 2002 of perpetrating one of the biggest military computer hacks of all time, hacked the server of \u201cThe Pentagon\u201d and learned about the secret of the country's defence.\n\nTo conclude, every technology has both positive and negative sides and its overall impact depends on the people who use and control them. Rational and proper use of computer technology would benefit us tremendously, but it can also bring disaster when we are overly dependant on it or misuse it.Sample Answer 2:\nMany people believe that computer technology has immensely helped the human race to progress, but others opine that it has more drawbacks than benefits. This essay examines how could computers be deemed an obstruction rather than a blessing.  \n\nMany people are addicted to computer and Internet technology. They have no social and personal life as their screen time is unbelievably high. Without a computer, many people believe that they cannot work or continue their study. This dependency makes them less creative and more inert. For example, some people who work in modern offices cannot work when the Internet connection is interrupted. This over-reliance could bring catastrophic results, especially in sensitive sectors. A simple mistake in an atomic energy research centre can destroy millions of lives.  \n\nMoreover, it is undeniable that overuse of computers has health hazards. One of the examples is the radiation from the computer screen, which damages our eyesight and cause headache. It has been reported that the number of people who wear glasses has increased significantly since the invention of computers. Besides, this device has negative effects on the way people socialise and interact with each other. With the invention of portable computers, tablets and smartphones, people remain busy with their devices rather than having face-to-face conversations or social interactions.

Before we had emails and cell phones, they could scarcely communicate with their family members. For instance, one of my cousins studies in New Zealand and he makes video calls, voice calls and sends emails and SMS to his family and friends almost daily, sometimes even multiple times a day.

The speed of electronic mails and phone calls are amazing. They are live and instantaneous. Many of these services are free and takes almost no additional cost than just the internet bills. This is unprecedented since in the past international calls used to cost an arm and a leg of people. With technology in place, people nowadays are making new friends beyond borders.

Cities are already over-populated, polluted and cramped with an overwhelming number of people. Only decentralisation and mandatory relocation can reverse the scenario.\n\nTo begin with, only 20 percent of the world population lived in cities at the beginning of the 20th century while this has already escalated to over 80%. This over-population in cities increases the crime rate, contributes to environmental pollutions, declines the living standard of citizens, creates cut-throat competitions and makes living cost higher. The traffic congestion is a direct result of it that kills thousand of man-hours each day. Besides, the housing problem in cities is getting worse day by day. According to a recent study, the lifestyle of cities is declining faster with the dramatic increase of its population.\n\nTo stop people from moving to metropolitan areas, the government has to adopt an effective decentralisation policy. If enough civil facilities and employment opportunities are created in the rural and suburban areas, a few people would move to cities. People primarily migrate to big cities to have better careers and earning prospects. To reverse it, the government has to start big projects to empower the rural people and forcibly move many factories and facilities to nearby countrysides. Education, treatment and entertainment facilities in cities attract many rural people and the only way to stop this influx of people is to add those facilities to the countrysides as well.\n\nIn conclusion, cities become less habitable with the inflow of mass people who come to have a better life but eventually face more problems. Decentralisation could be a very effective solution to invert this concerning trend.Sample Answer 2:\nRapid migration of people from rural areas to cities has created serious concerns in many countries. This essay suggests that a higher population is one of the profound impacts of this phenomenon that leads to numerous issues. It also proposes that creating facilitating, specifically entertainment and employment in rural areas, as a solution to it.\n\nUndoubtedly, a great number of city-dwellers, particularly in megacities is a major challenge for the municipalities and state authorities, which could considerably stem from the depopulation of rural areas. As a case in point, a vast number of the country residents have immigrated to Tehran in recent years. Because of this, Tehran is one of the most populous cities which leads to higher living costs, accommodation scarcity, pollution, traffic congestions, increasing crime rates and unhygienic living standard.\n\nStraightening out the problem of rural depopulation would not be practically simple. Yet, the government's investing in facilitating rural areas by recreation facilities and creating more job opportunities could be somehow effective in terms of persuading pastoral people rather than migrating to big cities. To illustrate, some way-out cities in Europe have implemented several projects concerning installing some recreation centres near the countries, which have notably appealed the rural people. In this way, it has been possible to control the migration to cities. Besides, many rural people migrate to cities for better jobs, treatments or education. Establishing quality schools, healthcare centres, and creating more employment opportunities could effectively reduce the migration trend.                                                   \n\nIn conclusion, over-population in cities creates numerous problems that threaten the living standard of cities.

There are discussions and arguments about whether smoking should be banned completely or not.\n\nFirst of all, smoking is detrimental to health. It causes lung cancer which ultimately leads to death. It might take a long time to show symptoms but it always happens. Secondly, it is a waste of money as smokers spend a lot of money on the cigarette. Addiction to smoking leads to addiction to marijuana, yaba etc. Eventually, the addicted people get involved in different types of crimes. They start collecting money by stealing, lying and robbing and the severity of the crime keeps on increasing. Moreover, smoking not only harm the smoker but also the people around them. Recent studies on smoking suggest that passive smoking is as harmful as active smoking.  \n\nOn the contrary, the tobacco industry is the source of huge tax for the government. Government makes the best utilization of the tax money by building schools, mosques, overhaul streets etc. Thousands of people work in cigarette-related industries and this creates huge job opportunities.

Another vague benefit of smoking is that smokers believe smoking refreshes their minds and relieves them from tension and stress, though it has not been scientifically proved.

What problems does this cause? How can we overcome the problems of poverty?", "extra_topic": "", "model_answer": "\nMore than 70% of global resources and wealth are controlled by only 7% of the population and it shows the overwhelming disparity of the resource distribution throughout the world. As a result of capitalism and improper distribution of facilities and resources, the poor are becoming even poorer while the rich are amassing more wealth. This causes unimaginable problems to the human and some steps should be implemented immediately to reduce the discrimination of wealth distribution.\n\nTo begin with, the inequality of wealth distribution increases delinquency. It is noticeable that the crime rate all around the world has significantly increased as the wealthier are getting more affluent and the poor are suffering to support their basic needs. The overall development of a country does not depend on a tiny portion of rich people, rather it depends on an active economy and fair wealth distribution. Moreover, when the discrimination between rich and poor increases, the political situation deteriorates and a country steps into the verse of corruption and civil war.\n\nTo overcome the poverty problem the state must emphasise quality education. Education is the single most important answer to this problem. Moreover, the government should utilise the resources a country has and support the small and medium entrepreneurs by providing subsidies. Finally, very fundamental needs like education and treatment should be funded by the state. For example, according to a recent article in a research journal, most rich nations in the world have been successful due to their better education system and fair governance system.  \n\nTo conclude, the increasing gaps between rich and needy brings many predicaments to a country and quality education is the solution to the poverty problem. The government must ensure an active economy in the country to ensure a fair resource distribution.Sample Answer 2:\nThe gap between the rich and the poor is widening fast than ever throughout the world. This enormous gap certainly causes a lot of problems that a nation must endure solving through various means. This essay discusses the problems associated with paucity and proposes some solutions to alleviate poverty.\n\nThere is almost an endless list of problems that stem from poverty. To name a few, scarcity of food, water, and clothing, weak shelters, the spread of dangerous diseases, indulgence in criminal activities, mental illness and low life expectancy. Poor people are trapped in horrendous insufficiency and cannot educate their children. The root cause of poverty is the lack of proper education and hence problems related to employment. This creates an evil circle of scarcity for poor families that they can not break. Moreover, poverty fuels up crimes in an area and this disturbs social harmony. Where the poor are struggling even harder to meet their basic means, the rich are getting pampered to the wealth and luxury. This discrimination can even lead to civil war.\n\nIn order to overcome the problems of poverty, governments should do a careful and considerable analysis of the distribution of funds and wealth throughout the country. Non-profit voluntary organisations should work actively in rural areas for the upliftment of the poor, mainly in education and skill development areas. Furthermore, the rich and the prosperous should contribute financially and work selflessly towards creating job opportunities and helping destitute people.\n\nTo conclude, the world would be a better place to live in only if we keep poverty from rising beyond limits.

Some people believe that children in wealthy families are over-indulged and do not learn many important lessons to face future challenges while middle-class and lower-middle-class families better prepare their offsprings. Personally, I believe that better parenting, regardless of family wealth or status, is more important.\n\nTo begin with, children from less wealthy families learn to face difficulties in life from early childhood. They know that they need to work hard to succeed in life, and they start to appreciate the value of money and time. It gives them a competitive advantage to face life in the future. For instance, the highest scorer in our college was from a lower-middle-class family and he devoted most of his time to study. He valued excellent academic results more than most students from wealthy families. He was convinced that the only way to get out of their financial problems was to become the top scorer and have a better career in the future. No doubt, this determination, hard work and mind-setup will help him become successful in life.\n\nReversely, children from wealthy families, most of the time, get better facilities, education and career opportunities. Despite being an average student, Patrick, one of my classmates, got admitted to the best private university in our country. This exemplifies that he has a better career prospect than the top scorer in our college. So, the connection, influence and money that rich families own often help them better educate their children while also giving a head start in life.\n\nPersonally, I believe that parenting is more important than having and spending money on children. It is not always the money that makes someone successful and a good citizen. When parents implant good qualities among children, these qualities alone can make a difference in their life.\n\nTo conclude, though it is generally believed that children from less fortunate families are better prepared for the future, I believe that proper parenting is far more important than any other factor.Sample Answer 2: (Disagreement)\nMoney plays a pivotal role in people's social and family life, and it influences the way a child grows up and prepares to meet future challenges. Usually, rich families compensate better life for their children, but some people argue that children who are brought up in less wealthy families are often better prepared to face difficulties in life. However, I strongly believe that children from affluent families get better opportunities and better prepared for future challenges.\n\nOn the one hand, many believe that families with less money prepare their children more realistically. Those children admittedly learn to face obstacles in their childhood that gives them an advantage when they grow up. They also learn to appreciate the value of money, savings, time and hard work, and the importance of family tie. They are not pampered for everything they want or need, rather they need to earn them through hard work. Therefore they automatically prepare for setting a target in life and make plans for pursuing them.\n\nOn the other hand, children from wealthier families are sometimes a little behind in terms of learning many important lessons in childhood when compared with the mindset of their counterparts. However, they have all the facilities they need for their education and future career. For instance, they are well adorned to go to the best schools, have the best teachers to teach them, money and connections to start a business or join a job, and affluent family to support them whenever needed. Furthermore, those families build the foundation for their children to begin their life- a much-needed push to have a better career. These rich children eventually learn the most important aspects of life, maybe a little later than the poor children, but they have far greater facilities that ultimately give them advantages in life.\n \nTo conclude, money and education build a better future life.

The shops are organised, give a better shopping experience, and save time by allowing customers to get whatever products they need under one roof. Moreover, the environment of shopping malls is way better than that of local markets. These shops accept digital payment methods, such as credit and debit cards, which is suitable for such cardholders. It is often said that shopping malls are the future of shopping while local markets are the concept of bygone days.\n\nOn the other hand, local markets also offer a wide range of advantages and products to people. The freshness of vegetables, fishes and fruits could be a great advantage of shopping from local markets. The cheap price is another reason why many people think local markets are better places for shopping. Local small business vendors sell their products in such a traditional market and they often support the local economy. Therefore, these advantages exemplify the advantages and importance of such traditional markets.\n\nTo conclude, shopping centres and local markets both have various positive aspects.

This is why many students, who do well in school, struggle while taking care of their finances in real life. Academic studies and financial intelligence cannot be seen as inherent contradictions but as two mutually independent competencies. So, I believe that the value of money and money management should be taught in schools.\n\nThe author of the book \u201cRich Dad Poor Dad\u201d terms Financial Independence as you being able to make your money work for you and not the other way around. Students who get to learn about how to spend, invest and save money rarely find themselves in financial predicaments despite what their salaries bring in. Such skills are often inculcated through family and teachers. And students, who lack these skills, usually find themselves with insufficient funds no matter how much their jobs pay them. They never learn to develop their assets. It renders them dependents on their jobs for life as it is their only source of income. The earnings are mostly spent on their liabilities leaving them with paltry savings.\n\nIf money management is taught as a part of the school curriculum, all the students will get a chance to learn such skills. They will grow up to have more knowledge of money and finance. Consecutively, they will have a better perspective while making financial decisions. This will lead to a more stable, enriched and self-reliant society. Lessons learned in schools last for a long and that is why teaching money management to students is so vital.\n \nTo conclude, earning money may not be the goal in life but it is the money that provides us with our basic needs and a sense of security.

Many schools are already overwhelmed with the subjects they teach, and adding personal financial affairs to the syllabus would make things worse. Moreover, this is a skill that teachers cannot instil in a person through lectures and exams. This is why I believe that parents should take this responsibility.\n\nTo commence with, no matter how many chapters someone reads or how many exams he or she takes on the value of money in life, until this person earns, saves and invests money, it is impossible to learn the practical aspect of personal finances for him or her. Teachers are not in a position to decide whether a student should work besides study, and manage his or her finance. Parents, on the other hand, are ideal to monitor and supervise this aspect. They can teach their children the value of money and put them in situations when they need to take responsibilities.\n\nMoreover, learning to manage someone's finance is a different type of skill that class lectures cannot teach. Finally, a teacher does not know every aspect of a student's family and their financial condition. This is why the same lecture is not suitable for all students when it comes to making financial decisions. Opposed to that, parents are in a far better position to let their children learn this essential life skill.\n\nTo conclude, money management is a practical aspect of life and theoretical classes conducted by school teachers are ineffective to develop this great skill.

Therefore the authorities should spend more money and manpower for ensuring road safety than retesting the driver's ability. It is a scientific fact that adept drivers are less likely to forget their driving skill unless they lose their sanity.

This is perhaps the primary reason they do not expect to have children in the early stage of their marriage. It is intuitively obvious that with huge competition, unemployment and economic crisis, people around the world are constantly worried about their career and salary.

Secondly, women empowerment and social changes have altered the old way of life where a woman's sole responsibility was to look after the children. Since many wives are working these days, they decide to take babies after they reach a certain position in their career.\n\nFurthermore, social belief regarding giving birth to children has changed dramatically, and people are more concerned about the living expenses than the number of babies they have, unlike in the past. Finally, enhanced life expectancy has also contributed to this trend as people believe they can wait a little longer to have their first baby.\n\nUndeniably, people who choose to concentrate on their career first and then have babies can take better care of their children due to ample career and economic freedom. Having offsprings early in life can escalate the expenditures and financial responsibilities of parents. Moreover, if they do not spend enough time with children, they grow up with psychological issues. Thus,  by having early children, young parents might put their career at a risk as well as the future of their children. Reversely, having offspring in early life have few advantages. Such parents have new members in their family and their isolation would be extirpated and they will become more family-oriented.\n\nIn conclusion, despite the pleasure of having a new baby in the early years of marriage, parents who decide to have babies later can focus on their career, fulfil financial goals and have sufficient time to spend with the family.[Written by - Faisal ]", "original_link": "https://www.ielts-mentor.com/writing-sample/writing-task-2/2464-people-decide-to-have-children-later-in-their-life"}, {"essay_topic": "Differences between countries become less evident each year.

Although this trend has some benefits, I would agree that the disadvantages are more noteworthy.\n\nOn the one hand, the global reach of fashion brands, similar eating habits and similar traditions of people have some major benefits. For instance, Starbucks, the renowned coffee chain, has grown from a single outlet in Seattle to as many as 30,000 shops in around sixty countries. Nearly identical stores serve cups of coffee to hundreds and thousands of customers, no matter whether you are sipping it in New York, London, New Delhi, Melbourne or Istanbul.

Food import includes transportation costs, taxation and other charges that eventually increase the food price. To tackle this problem, a government should allocate more budgets to improve national production by maximising the collaboration of research centres with farmers. Related university courses and diploma programmes can create more talented individuals who would be involved in domestic food production. Furthermore, by mass production of all kinds of food items, a country can prepare for the rainy days.\n\nSecondly, by focusing on farming, irrigation and planting, a government can decrease unemployment problems.

More than 50 per cent of Indonesians are directly or indirectly depends on the agriculture sector.\n\nFinally, imported food does not have the same quality and freshness as locally produced food and crops.

However, many people would also argue that it is better to bestow a prosperous country to the new generation rather than leaving them a broken economy.\n\nFurthermore, economic progress requires industrialisations, dominance in international trade and the use of cheap labours from other countries. History tells us that wars are imminent due to irrational competition among nations. On the contrary, without economic success, a country cannot defend itself from external threats, fight with epidemic diseases and cannot ensure proper health care facilities to its citizens. Finally, some would say, with the economic progress, the country will lose its old way of living, traditional values and uniqueness as a nation. But it should also be considered that change is the fundamental basis of development and if a nation worries too much about the old ways of living, it would fail to ensure progress at a steady pace.\n\nIn conclusion, there is no doubt that economic progress should be an important goal for a government but there are still many aspects which are equally important.Sample Answer 2:\nThe progress of a nation is often measured by economic growth, therefore many governments focus more on their economic progress rather than other aspects. However, some people, including me, have a contrasting view as they believe that political stability, security, social condition and education are equally important for the advancement of a nation.\n\nOn the one hand, many governments pay more attention to economic development than other aspects of life as they believe that economic growth plays an important role in the development of a nation. When a country's economy develops, it ensures business ventures, new job opportunities and the government can collect more funds through taxes. This fund could be used for the improvement of other sectors such as education, public infrastructures and military services.  \n\nOn the other hand, even though economic growth plays an essential part, governments must ensure a better living standard and a green environment. The economic condition of a country will not grow without the support of a secure social condition, better political condition and advanced educational system. Investors will not place their investment in countries that have an insecure political condition such as Afganistan or Iraq. And then, without the existence of educated and skilled workers, it will be difficult for a country to improve their industrial and trade activities. Therefore, the growth of the economic sectors should be aligned with other important sectors.\n\nIn conclusion, it is undeniable that economic growth plays an important role in the development of a nation. However, I personally believe that besides economic progress, better education, social welfare, security and political stability are equally important for the sustainable development of a nation.", "original_link": "https://www.ielts-mentor.com/writing-sample/writing-task-2/2445-economic-progress-is-the-most-important-goal"}, {"essay_topic": "Many high-level positions in companies are filled by men even though the workforce in many developed countries is more than 50 percent female. So companies should be required to allocate a certain percentage of these positions to women.", "extra_topic": "", "model_answer": " (Disagreement)\nIn recent years, the role of women in society as well as in job sectors has changed to a great extent. However, it is noteworthy that higher positions in firms are still occupied by men, although women account for half of the workforce in many developed countries. While some people claim that women should be promoted more to hold these positions, I disagree with this idea as I believe that higher positions should be served by deserving people and should not be allocated based on genders.\n\nFirst, recruiting for higher positions in a company should never be based on genders, but qualifications, skills and aptitudes. This is because choosing people who cannot adapt to the working conditions will make companies confront many difficulties - even this can affect the profit, productivity and the public image. For instance, in my brother\u2019s workplace, two women were recruited in two higher positions only because they were relatives of the owner. Within a few months, the management had to replace both of them with more competent employees. Therefore, a company should always choose the best people to serve their important positions. If a female candidate seems more promising or if an existing female employee has excellent capabilities, there should not be any problem in recruiting or promoting a woman in a higher position.\n\nAgain, if percentage or number is the most crucial factor, I believe children should also be promoted to higher positions in a company in a developing country as their percentage in factories and industries in those countries is also high. This exemplifies why qualifications should get priority over other aspects when it comes to hiring people for higher management positions in a company.\n\nIn conclusion, I strongly believe that employees should be recruited according to their expertise, eligibilities and talent. It is therefore recommended that women who want to play important roles in an organisation should gain those qualifications and skills. They should not be favoured only because of their gender.[Written by - Aman]", "original_link": "https://www.ielts-mentor.com/writing-sample/writing-task-2/2444-companies-should-allocate-percentage-of-these-positions-to-women"}, {"essay_topic": "Some people opine that increasing office hour is a reason for many social and personal problems and that is why it should be reduced to 35 hours in a week. What are the advantages and disadvantages of reducing the working week to 35 hours?", "extra_topic": "", "model_answer": "\nA balanced professional and personal life is the key to happiness - according to many researchers. This is why a group of people suggest reducing the office hours to 35 hours per week to allow employees to have more free time. It is undeniable that overwork causes stress and hamper productivity in the long run, but a workday of 7 hours may also reduce productivity and output.\n\nTo outline the advantages, 35 working hours per week will allow employees to allocate more time for themselves and spend quality time with family and friends. Besides, they will be inspired to take part in different social and sports activities, and that will surely improve their health conditions. Moreover, the reduced working hours means more time for resting and taking vacations, and proper rest and vacations refresh our minds. Undeniably, this has a relationship with the productivity of employees in their offices. Finally, many stress-related issues are caused by overwork, and if employees work 7 hours a day, they are less likely to suffer from fatigue and stress.\n\nOn the other hand, decreased working hours would reduce the output of employees, especially in industries and that would hike the price of different commodities. Life would become even more costly due to the increasing price. Companies, on the other hand, will have to hire more employees to maintain their productivity and thus their operational cost would increase.\n\nTo conclude, a balanced working hour is already in place, which is 8 hours per day. Employees should work effectively during office hours and leave the office in due time. Companies should not put extra pressure and engage staff for more than 8 hours a day while the government should make sure that private companies are not violating the laws regarding the weekly working hours.Sample Answer 2:\nDifferent social and personal problems due to overwork are arguably the most concerning dilemmas in the modern world, both for developing and industrialised countries. It is suggested by many to have a 35-hours workweek schedule, as they believe it would help diminish many overwork-related issues. This essay will give an in-depth analysis of both advantages and disadvantages of the proposed working hours.\n\nIt seems reasonable that a shorter working week can boost the demand for new employment while also provide a healthier working condition. As workers are expected to work five hours less per week, the companies have to consider additional recruitment to keep up with the former productivity, thus help in lowering the unemployment quota. Moreover, studies have highlighted the importance of granting employees a greater amount of time for resting. Not only it will lead to better performance, but also improve employee satisfaction, from which the organisations can benefit a lot.\n\nOn the other hand, there are bound to be pitfalls once the suggestion gets passed. Economically speaking, cutting working hours can severely hurt companies\u2019 competitiveness in the market, since they are no longer as effective. The situation may get even worse if all firms suffer from the same problem. Prices are then likely to be raised so that the expenses can be covered. Ironically, the employees, who are also customers, turn out again to be the victims of the solution suggested.\n\nTo conclude, limiting the working week to 35 hours might sound promising but there are several potential issues, which must be thoroughly addressed before the proposal could be implemented in the real world.", "original_link": "https://www.ielts-mentor.com/writing-sample/writing-task-2/2439-reducing-the-working-week-to-35-hours"}, {"essay_topic": "Some people claim that not enough of the waste from homes is recycled. They say that the only way to increase recycling is for governments to make it a legal requirement.", "extra_topic": "", "model_answer": "\nWaste recycling and people\u2019s participation in it is a moot issue, and a lot of arguments could be observed among people as well as in the media regarding this. Whether people should spontaneously take part in the recycling process or the government should make it a legal obligation needs through discussion. I personally believe that government should impose laws and severely fine the violators to ensure proper waste recycling.\n\nTo commence with, waste recycling is done by the state and citizens are expected to properly divide the recyclable and non-recyclable wastages and pack them accordingly while dumping them in recycle bins. They are expected to cooperate greatly in the recycling process. However, it is a strange fact that many people do not participate in it spontaneously either from their negligence or from their lack of time to do so.\n\nMoreover, it is a harsh truth that many people abide by rules only from the concern of punishment or fine, not from their conscience. For instance, when the penalty for traffic rule violation went up last year, people started following them in my city. Similarly, if laws are introduced and the authority starts penalising, more people would recycle more of their wastages.\n\nFinally, waste recycling is a very handy process to save our environment and we already have many rules to protect our environment. While deforesting is a severe crime in my country, there is no visible law for not recycling waste. This is why people are very careless about their waste management in our country. This is why proper laws are required.\n\nIn conclusion, most of the citizens in our country already know about the importance of saving the environment and how individual efforts of recycling can improve environmental conditions. Since many of them still do not participate in waste recycling, there is no alternative than to impose laws to have this done.", "original_link": "https://www.ielts-mentor.com/writing-sample/writing-task-2/2438-not-enough-of-the-waste-from-homes-is-recycled"}, {"essay_topic": "Some people say that the only reason for learning a foreign language is in order to travel to or work in a foreign country. Others say that these are not the only reasons why someone should learn a foreign language.", "extra_topic": "", "model_answer": "\nLearning a foreign language has many advantages including augmenting knowledge about diverse cultures, having better job prospects, fostering better cognitive development, developing effective communication skills and so on. While some people believe that the only reason we should learn a foreign language is to visit or work in a foreign country, many others opine that the benefits of learning a different language are not limited to the job and travel prospects only.  This essay delves into both points of views. My opinion is that learning a foreign language goes beyond travel, migration or job prospects.\n\nOn the one hand, it is quite natural that people want to learn a foreign language only to be able to communicate with people who speak this language. Thus a large number of people learn foreign languages like English, French, German, Spanish, Russian and Arabic to travel, migrate or find jobs in countries where people use these languages. From this regards, it seems quite logical that visiting a country or working there is the main reason people learn a second language. In my country, for example, most people learn English and Spanish while almost none learn Russian. Migration and job prospects are the reason that has established this trend, I believe.\n\nOn the contrary, research indicates that cognitive development happens faster among children who learn a second language than those who do not. Furthermore, learning a second language is mandatory in an academic syllabus and this helps us understand diverse cultural and traditional aspects. People who know more languages are capable of reading more books, and understanding the lifestyle of different nationalities. Again, learning a foreign language helps us make new friends. Thus it is evident that learning a foreign language has many other benefits as well.\n\nIn conclusion, there is no denying the fact that people primarily learn a foreign language to travel to or work in a developed country. But it is quite evident that there are far many advantages of learning a foreign language than to work or migrate to a country.", "original_link": "https://www.ielts-mentor.com/writing-sample/writing-task-2/2437-reason-for-learning-a-foreign-language"}, {"essay_topic": "Governments should spend money on railways rather than roads.", "extra_topic": "", "model_answer": "\nEvery government works hard so that citizens can commute safely and quickly while businesses get a solid transportation system for trade facilities. Thus when the question arises whether a government should focus on improving its railways or roads, people have divided opinions. I personally agree that a government should spend more money on the railway system.\n\nFast of all, railways offer a safer commuting experience both for the citizens and traders. The numbers of road accidents and highway casualties in many countries, for example, are far higher than that of railway accidents. Thus investing in a safer mode of transportation is a much more prudent idea. Moreover, rails cause comparatively less environmental pollutions while road vehicles are the main reason for increasing pollution and around the world.\n\nSecond, rails can carry hundreds of people and several hundred tonnes of goods at a time while road transports not built for that. Some shuttle trains are many times faster than that those of private cars and public buses. Thus improved railways would save peoples\u2019 valuable time every day. Thirdly, rail lines are usually away from the main cities and that is why some busy cities have no other alternatives than to improve their rail transportation system. Express trains can reduce the traffic congestion in metro areas, and more investment to improve the railway is the only possible solutions in many cities where population density is high.\n\nFinally, the population of the world is increasing rapidly, and that is why investing more money in a faster and reliable transportation system is more logical than investing in the older transportation system. Railways will be the future in the transportation sector, and investment in it is the better choice for any government.\n\nIn conclusion, I believe that a government, either in a developed or a developing country, should invest to build a safer, faster and more reliable transportation system, and the railway, for this reason, should get an obvious priority.Sample Answer 2:\nSome people believe that a government should invest more in the rail system and build more railroads rather than diverting funds to improving highways and road transportation system. To a certain point, I would agree with the statement, but I also believe that the decision of building railways or roads should be made based on the natural conditions of the area and the preference of citizens.\n\nOn the one hand, it is understandable if some people opine that a government should expand more railroads rather than roads and streets. Firstly, it is obvious that when a country has extensive rail networks, it will positively affect the logistic cost. The selling price of many goods would be cheaper since a single locomotive could carry tonnes of crops, goods or liquor. Secondly, by building integrated subway stations in city areas, traffic congestion could be avoided. For example, as Singapore has a very good train network, called MRT, most of the people rarely drive on their vehicles. As a result, Singapore is free from traffic congestion and air pollution.\n\nOn the other hand, it is also important for a government to do some feasibility studies about the geological conditions of an area before planning to improve railroads. It is a fact that some areas might not be suitable for railways, as those areas might have swamps or rocky mountains, for example. If the government finalise building railway networks, the investment cost might be unreasonably high. For instance, Borneo in Indonesia is one of the largest islands in the world, but most of the areas are swamps. So it is not suitable for railroads but good for an integrated water and road transportation system. Finally, the preference of citizens should also be considered before investing in construction on railroads or highways.\n\nIn conclusion, a government should invest in building railroads where applicable, but should also analyse thoroughly before spending money solely on railways. The authority needs to ensure that their areas are suitable for rail networks and people prefer that transportation system.", "original_link": "https://www.ielts-mentor.com/writing-sample/writing-task-2/2436-governments-should-spend-money-on-railways-rather-than-roads"}, {"essay_topic": "Some people believe that the main purpose of schools is to turn children into good citizens and workers instead of benefitting them individually.", "extra_topic": "", "model_answer": " (Agreement)\nSchools are considered to be the lighthouse of a nation, and if education is the backbone of a nation, schools are the place to build it. However, the main objective of academies is a never-ending debate. I agree that a school's main purpose should be to turn students into honest and good citizens and making them ready to work for society instead of turning them into selfish money-making machines by helping them individually just to be ready to get a job.\n\nFirst, the main purpose of education is to build up an enlightened nation where morality, honesty and integrity would be the key characteristics. They would keep aside their personal ambitions, and work together for the betterment of the country. Since a school is a place where pupils' education is taken care of, its chief objective should be to focus on nurturing morality and good human characteristics among the students while also preparing them for their careers that would benefit society. To exemplify, if talented and experienced doctors treat patients only for the money, healthcare for all would be a distant dream. So, to build a nation where people will help each other instead of turning into money-making machines, we should focus on our education system, especially what we teach our children.\n\nSecond, states spend a lot of money to keep the schools and their education system running. A major portion of this spending comes from the tax money. From this regards, if schools plan to adopt an education system where teachers\u2019 sole purpose would be to teach children how to be personally benefitted from jobs or businesses, the whole education system would collapse. We have to be very careful while educating our children. What we teach them in their early stages would shape them, and if the schools fail to teach them to become ideal citizens, it would be a great concern in the future. Moreover, personal benefits, good grades and better career should not be the main reasons children attend schools. They should attend schools to become enlightened members of society.\n\nIn conclusion, making ideal citizens and dedicated workers should be the true objective of our schools.

Now the question arises if this trend supposed to be blamed for the poor health of the young generation or not. This essay delves into this issue.\n\nThe more they watch their favourite sports on TV, the more they become addicted to watching it, whilst the evolution of sports on television was not meant to do that. The motive to promote sports on televisions was to inform people of sports activities and to instil a feeling of vigour and enthusiasm in people, particularly among young people, so that they take part in different sports. However, these days, the young generation takes watching sports on television as a leisure activity. Instead of inspiring, it has rather instilled a feeling of apathy about taking part in outdoor sports among youth by occupying their free time.\n\nMoreover, the young one's, these days, just love to have a gala time watching sports.

Do you believe that it is fair?", "extra_topic": "", "model_answer": "\nMany foreign universities have a dual policy in case of their tuition fees as they charge foreign students higher than the local students. International students often need to pay up to 400 percent more than local students when it comes to higher education in countries like Australia, New Zealand, Canada and the UK. This is also the case in many other countries and a government's obligation to its citizens, enforcing national privilege, tax payment by the local people and restricting the numbers of international students are the main reasons, I believe.\n\nTo begin with, different tuition fees for local and international students gives an impression that \u2018you are not equal\u2019 and when we are fighting for the equal rights in every country, the discrimination in the university tuition fee seems like an unfair one. However, the university authority often states that this is a policy that actually ensures better educational environment and fairness in the university campuses. First reason they mention for the different higher education fees is the government\u2019s obligation to its citizens. A government has a natural obligation to education its citizens while educating foreign students is not a direct obligation it has. This also ensures that a government is enforcing the national privilege to its citizens while using the extra money earned from the international students for the improvement of the university education. Third, citizens of a country pay the tax to the government and thus should get the privilege in educating their next generation. Finally, higher university education costs help to control the international students' flow in a country.\n\nTo conclude, providing some opportunities to the local university students is not a bad idea but imposing up to 5x charges to the international students is an unfair policy in my opinion. It's unbelievable how far the university authorities are willing to push international students to get their pay and earn the extra money.

A wide variety of machines is performing numerous tasks in a perfect manner and with the shortest possible time. The sole aim of the machines is to comfort us and in the future, we will have more leisure hours as machines will replace our tasks. Now, I will describe both the benefits and disadvantages of this dependency on machines.\n\nTo begin with, machines are meant to ease human activities. Usually, machines are able to perform tasks flawlessly than humans and in the future, they will just do that. So, they will be considered to be the substitute for humans in many tasks which require ultimate excellence and physical challenges. At the same time, machines can perform several tasks together and save time - for instance, a computer can analyse a massive amount of data in a single second. This is why in the future, the machines will be used in the war, research, construction and human will have more leisure time due to that.\n\nOn the contrary, there are some detrimental impacts of machines and this will be more severe in the future. Certainly, machines will relieve us from repetitive tasks, but they will create few complexities too. When people will leave manual works, the risks of health disorders will increase. They may get affected with several life-tolling diseases for their physical inactivity that they used to do before engaging machines for their comforts. Besides, I believe that machines will also create a mass unemployment. When machines will be used for large-scale production in factories, many human labours will be eliminated from those jobs. The dependency on machines would be extreme and due to this a single instance of failure or wrong instruction would bring catastrophic results.  \n\nTo wrap up the discussion, I think it is imperative to deploy machines in only some specific sectors which are beyond the reach of humans. Further, the increased leisure will make life boring for us, and so we should be engaged in the ordinary tasks to enjoy a happy and healthy life.

As a result, they are happy with their working life. The view may vary but I completely agree to this.\n\nFrequently, the dream of taking up a career begins in early part of life. When kids are in schools, they compose essays on \u2018Aim in Life\u2019 where they mention about intentions to do in their adulthood. Consequently, they try to get into the track they cherished and most of them win the career and grow well in all terms. So, when they are in desired track, they are satisfied with their working life. The early career gives enough time for thinking or even switching career. People who start working at an early stage have better skills and better control of their professional life.\n\nIn opposite, in my life, I have met with some unhappy people with their career path. They blame misfortune because they wanted to take something else as their career but they are to work on a completely different track which brings the sense of dissatisfaction. For instance, a science graduate who is a friend of mine is now handling banking transactions and an English graduate friend of mine is solving Chemistry problems in a lab! It really turns troublesome for them to bring satisfaction in their career as neither they were ready to deal with the matters nor they had intentions. Most of these people start their career at a later stage and become stuck to something.  \n\nFor a satisfying working life, I believe, people would like to have some specific issues in line with their regular salaries like a cosy working environment, flexible working hours and some extra benefits etc. If they have the facilities, they would be able to focus more on the work which gradually will bring the sense job satisfaction. However, my personal experience taught me that job satisfaction for all employees ios not possible and people's expectation for their jobs vary to a great extent.

A brief of the matter is discussed below.  \n\nFirst of all, tennis is preferred for its several advantages. It helps to make the body fit and reduces risks for diseases like diabetes, heart disorders etc. Overall mental health is also achieved from this sport. But the most important disadvantage is \u2013 tennis is not fit for everyone. Adults over 45 are suggested not to participate in tennis.

As a result, the quality of life becomes poorer. It is more prevalent in the developed countries. There are several causes that lead to the problem and those are described in the following paragraphs in brief.\n\nLack of childhood parental care is one of the leading issues for crime in the developed countries,- believe many social activists. Kids exercise violence from their high schools and it happens as they lack the right guidance and parental care. Since they are not taken care by parents, they commit different sorts of crime and there are lots of examples in Europe and the USA where the young people have been found guilty in different crime situations \u2013 even in murder.\n\nSecondly, I believe, insecurity and discrimination lead people to break the law. When they cannot get their rights as they were supposed to be, they try taking control of the rights themselves which consequently leads to criminal activities. A kid of a single mother or single father family is more prone to commit crimes and a 1983 study reveals that 60% of child abuse occurred in such conditions by the mother or the father which lead to a behavioural disorder among them and inspire in violating the law.\n\nSo, solving the issue appears really daunting as the problem did not grow overnight. The corrective measures should come first from the family. When a child will know about its social responsibilities and how things work, it will behave in order. The parents, teachers and other relatives have to take responsibility for children to make them better citizens. The government must make sure that the citizens have the access to proper education and other human rights. A combination effort of both people and the government is required to tackle the crime.  \n\nIn summary, a sense of security should be developed among adult people feeling threatened by the society and thus they could be prevented from being outlaws.

I personally believe that a proper colour represents a good will and shows tenderness and this is why public buildings should have proper colour and decoration.\n\nTo begin with, we are associated with different colours from the very beginning of our life. Parents and teachers teach us different colours and scientists believe that a child\u2019s ability to classify different colours is connected with his calibre and talent. Thus our brains associate this colours with our moods and feelings. For instance, the red light on the streets sends an immediate alert to our brain to stop our vehicle while the green colour signals us to go ahead. Thus we are trained to react and feel differently with the association of colours. From this perspective, it is important to use soothing and accepted colours in places like schools, hospitals and offices.\n\nFurthermore, we tend to associate colours with different events from our personal experience.

Besides, people in some countries relate colours with certain moods.

Government funding should reflect this.", "extra_topic": "", "model_answer": "Sample Essay:\nIt is sometimes argued that more money should be spent on preventive measures than treatments, as they are of greater importance. However, I would argue that cure and prevention are equally important when it comes to spending money in these areas.\n\nThere are several reasons why it can be argued that government should spend money on tackling the causes of diseases. Cost-effectiveness is the key element when placing more importance on these initiatives. By allowing people to have access to these health monitoring strategies, governments can avoid the hefty priced hospitalised treatments or other extravagantly expensive medicines. Take the modified gene coding as an example, the technique of relocating genes in the DNA of human beings can help deliberately avoiding inherited lethal illnesses in newborns such as diabetes. In this way, not only the financial pressure on health care departments can be reduced, but also the painful suffering caused by these contagious sicknesses. Hence, an improved quality of life for those who take these measures is a better alternative. So, if government prioritises preventative approaches as a mandatory element in tackling health problems, people would surely be leading healthy lives in a near future.\n\nI also believe that spending on treatments or medicines has of proportionately equal importance as of managing causes. Some diseases are too fatal that cannot be left without an intensive, holistic and advanced treatment. For instance, carcinogenic patients would have never been recovered with ever greater speed today, if huge state budget were not invested to produce chemotherapy. Similarly, without enough government funds for the best possible treatments to vulnerable patients, people' life expectancy will be affected devastatingly. So both these departments should be given equal money to keep them going.\n\nIn conclusion, governments have to make health reforms properly by investing equally in the cure and prevention of epidemic health illnesses in order to have better outcomes from health deprived people as well as ensuring a healthy and energetic living for them.[ Written by - Shamaila Afzal ]", "original_link": "https://www.ielts-mentor.com/writing-sample/writing-task-2/2349-ielts-writing-task-2-sample-1081-prevention-of-health-problems-is-more-important-than-treatment"}, {"essay_topic": "Many people believe that companies and individuals should pay to clean up the environment in proportion to the amount of pollution they have produced.", "extra_topic": "", "model_answer": "Sample Essay:\nIt is often argued that people should be charged in accordance with the amount of pollution they produce. While I accept that certain organisations should be penalised for this, I believe that every individual should not be forced to pay a fine.\n\nThere are several reasons why the giant entrepreneurs should pay for contaminating the land. Having penalised with a specific amount of money factories will help the government to raise money which can be used in a variety of long-term and rationalised measures to mitigate the pollution from the earth. This will also deter them from producing more garbage and pollution. Take London as an example, where governments have invested recently a hefty amount of money in public transportation, in particular, local buses which have been designed to be much more efficient than the older ones. So these vehicles discharge fewer combustible pollutants into the air. Also, these self-centered companies sometimes exploit natural resources such as forests, water land and agricultural lands, beyond all their limits just to increase the profit. If these companies are not obliged to share the amount of money, which is required to curb pollutions, they will become more short-sighted (or greedy) in terms of making more money without even caring about the impact on climate change and environment.\n\nHowever, I would argue that every individual should not be liable to pay recommended fine. It is unrealistic that we can stop people from polluting the universe merely by imposing charges. Because people need electricity to enjoy technologies, a farmland to grow crops and an accommodation to live, food to eat as well as a mean of transportation to travel. Furthermore, if people from devastated backgrounds are charged more for the impact they have on climate; it will create an upheaval situation where lower-income groups would not be able to pay even for their daily necessities.\n\nIn conclusion, organisations who are earning millions of pounds by exploiting natural resources should only be obliged to share the amount of money in curbing the pollution rather than all the common citizens.[ Written by - Shamaila Afzal ]", "original_link": "https://www.ielts-mentor.com/writing-sample/writing-task-2/2348-ielts-writing-task-2-sample-1080-companies-and-individuals-should-pay-to-clean-up-the-environment"}, {"essay_topic": "Genetic engineering is an important issue in modern society.

Although it is sometimes thought that it has numerous benefits to humanity, others are of the opinion that it could bring destruction to the ecosystem. However, my opinion on that issue is that both negative and positive effects of genetic engineering should be carefully researched and then should be used for the greater good of humanity.\n\nThere are certain factors of the genetically engineering products. Firstly, crop modification will bring resistant to various plant diseases and it also targets infestation of unwanted insects. In other words, the amount of pesticides and fertiliser used are reduced. Furthermore, many countries are producing genetically engineered crops to produce a good variety of plants and abundant harvest. Genetic engineering can also address the increased food demands of people around the globe. Many diseases that human genetically inherits can be fought against with the improvement of genetic engineering and it can also ensure a generation.   \n\nHowever, some people argue that it brings long-term effects to humanity and environment. Certain reasons for these are the concerns of human health in which most modified foods contain toxins that are harmful to us. Also, it produces a minimal amount of nutrition. Another major concern is the potential harm to the environment- once genetically modified organisms are released into the wild, it interbreeds with the native organism and creates new species that may not be desirable.\n\nFinally, in my view, it is essential to look at the positive side it brings to humanity. As the population grows, the demand for food supply is increasing, thus, the natural method cannot cope the demand of the people. In this way, scientific way of plantation and farming are fundamental in our environment. Many diseases that cause death to a large number of people could be prevented using the blessing of genetic engineering.\n\nIn conclusion, there are good arguments for and against genetic engineering, so people must continue to research various methods to minimise the negative side effects of engineering products to ensure the betterment of every individual in the future.[ Written by - William Cruz ]", "original_link": "https://www.ielts-mentor.com/writing-sample/writing-task-2/2347-ielts-writing-task-2-sample-1079-genetic-engineering-is-an-important-issue"}, {"essay_topic": "Many museums charge for admission while others are free. Do you think the advantages of charging people for admission to museums outweigh the disadvantages?", "extra_topic": "", "model_answer": "\nA museum is an entity that preserves the artifacts of history and works as an important representative of a nation\u2019s tradition and culture. Thus the importance of museums to convey the historical facts to the new generation is beyond controversy. However, there are scopes to discuss whether entry to a museum should be free or not. I personally believe that there should be no charge for the museum entry as charging people for that have more demerits.\n\nTo begin with, ticket money for museum entrance discourages many students and low-income families to visit them. The collection of large museums increases day by day and thus people need to visit museums on a regular basis, not just once in a lifetime. When people need to spend money to witness history, many of them prefer going to movies instead. Furthermore, museums are mostly run by state funds and like public parks, sea beaches and libraries, they should be free of cost. The main reason museums get public funds is to convey the national history to the young people and to act as a national pride, not to earn from ticket money. From this regards, charging people for visiting museums have far more demerits than an ignorable advantage it offers.\n\nProponents of museum entrance fee believe that the ticket money is necessary for its maintenance while they fail to realise that this cost could easily be covered by the tax payers\u2019 money. Charging these people and their children again is unrealistic. Finally, free entry to the museum would attract more international visitors and spread the cultural uniqueness to the world and thus bring more tourists to a country. If there are charges, tourists would visit more popular places than the museums.\n\nTo conclude, free entrance to museums have numerous long terms and immediate benefits that far outweigh the single monetary advantage ticket money system has.

Both of these views have arguments for and against them and this essay delves these views and expresses my opinion before drawing a reasonable conclusion.\n\nOn the one hand, a university is the highest citadel for education in a country and it is considered that it builds the next adept generation who would lead the country. From this regards, the education and teaching policy of the university affect the whole nation. Some experts are in the opinion that students at university level should be given a certain freedom while picking majors they study in and there should not be any predefined syllabus. They opine that forcing them to study some latest subjects for the future employment would make them become workers for offices, not leaders for the country. They also express that letting them study a wide range of subjects would make them far more knowledgeable and prepared to take challenges and this policy would inspire tertiary level students to follow their dream and not just blindly run for their career. Furthermore, society needs as many artists as there are as many scientists. Forcing university students to study only science and teach related subjects would create an imbalance in our society.  \n\nOn the contrary, the university authority must consider the consequences of letting students choose their subjects. A recent study shows that predefined syllabus-bound a student study regularly and prepares for the exam while freedom to take any subject dramatically increases the number of dropout students. This is an alarming issue and this is why the university authority needs to think twice before implementing the policy. Furthermore, development of a nation, these days, highly depends on the technologically sound workforce and universities should yield such workforce for the country. From this perspective, it seems quite logical for universities to teach science related subjects to most of its students.           \n\nTo conclude, universities have to consider the pros and cons of any policy adopted including whether the students are free to pick their subjects or not.

This distraction could completely spoil the reading environment for which they are meant for. Secondly, if there is a ban on the usage of mobile phones in railway stations, is there a possibility for the work to progress without any disruption or stagnation.

First and foremost, unlike the past, today the number of broken and single-parent families is increasing. Children from such families cannot focus completely on their studies as they are not mentally healthy and happy. For example, in India, a recent survey report showed that failure rate is much higher among children who come from problematic families than the other children. Next, nutritional status is another important fact. Since pupils have more things to study, they often skip breakfast to save time.

I believe this trend has more negative consequences than the few positive outcomes it offers.\n\nThe single-person family is seen to be positive from better personal skill development and economic perspective. A single-member family forces a person to learn some basic skills including cooking, cleaning the house, paying the utility bills, managing personal finance, purchasing daily commodities, adopting hobbies and many more important skills. This makes someone self-dependent which has a greater impact on the development of the country in a broader sense. For instance, research shows that students who stay away from home for their tertiary degrees learn more skills and become more self-dependent than pupils who study from home. Moreover, a single-person family member is bound to do a job, business or have some sort of arrangement for a steady earning and this trend has a great positive impact on a country\u2019s economy.     \n\nFrom the opposite viewpoint, the trend of increasing single-person family has many negative consequences. Firstly, the increasing trend of living alone has a direct relationship on the percentage of people suffer from psychological problems these days. Living alone creates loneliness and depression, unlike the traditional family where there are always others to share someone\u2019s distress and sadness. The isolation often leads people to choose a lifestyle that is often negative. A recent study reveals that single-person family members often rely on drugs and many of them become addicted. The human is a social being and living alone is against their natural tendency. For many, bearing the total expenses is tough and this leads them to get involved in crimes.\n\nIn conclusion, the number of single-person families is increasing these days and this has some positive aspects despite many severe negative consequences.

Punishment is necessary to help them learn this distinction.", "extra_topic": "To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?", "model_answer": "\nHow much freedom a child should be given and what sort of punishment could be used to control them is a matter of great concern. Undeniably, too much freedom and lack of necessary control often lead youngsters to go astray while too much punishment makes them dull and less creative. I personally believe that punishment is meant to help children learn lessons and that is why certain punishments that do not involve beating the children is useful.\n\nTo begin with, early childhood experience and lessons have lasting impacts on someone\u2019s life and that is why parents and teachers should try their best to teach morality and good qualities to children. Children are curious and sometimes less mature to understand certain harmful effects of doing something while every father and mother want the offspring to become an ideal and exemplary person in life. They often need to use certain punishment to teach a valuable lesson to a youngster and the sole purpose of this punishment should be teaching a morality, should not be driven by any sort of personal anger or frustration. Physically beating a boy or a girl is in no way should be used as there are far better ways of punishing a child to teach him something.\n\nWhile physical punishment is no longer used in most of the developed countries, it could still be found in underdeveloped countries. This form of punishment, in my opinion, should not be used. More effective penalties could be not talking to the child for a misconduct or not taking him to the playground for a day or two. Similarly, parents could refrain from awarding the child with chocolate or toys and reminding the child why he does not deserve those. If parents have a friendly relationship with the children and simply expressing their frustration for an act of the child, that would work like the magic. From my personal experience, I can say that I took matters more seriously when my father stopped talking to me for a certain period for something he disliked about me and I vowed many times to myself not to do that again.\n\nTo conclude, punishment is necessary to teach children morality and help them learn to distinguish good things from bad ones.

While most of the people, especially parents, think that this is a waste of valuable time and this time should be utilised for learning academic lessons or taking part in outdoor activities, very few think playing computer games is helpful for children\u2019s cognitive development. I firmly believe that children should play computer games particularly brain games and strategy games but a balance should be maintained so that it does not become an addiction.\n\nIn the highly developed technological modern world, it is important for children to play computer games. Firstly, by doing this they can learn how to use computers and become familiar with new technology. Moreover, children communicate to each other at school during the break and often discuss different strategies of some particular computer game. Not only they develop their skills and knowledge such as 3D vision, imagination, and fantasy by playing those, but also computer game is the new modern way of leisure activity for young people, which help them develop thinking patterns, have friends online and build an online world. Many computer games are great learning resources and therefore parents and teacher should supervise what type of games a child play and how much time they spend on that.\n\nOn the other hand, spending too much time on computer games might be dangerous for children. For example, some children may not do their homework because they become addicted to computer games and play those most of the time. Also, children have less face-to-face communication with their friends and families as they are busy with games. Furthermore, some of youngest might even become aggressive as computer games expose them to violence and fighting. Therefore, the assistance from adults is needed to help children to keep a balance between computer games and other compulsory deals. Spending too much time can be detrimental to the children\u2019s health, especially for their eyes.\n\nTo conclude, a balance is required to ensure children are not playing computer games too much and spending a lot of time in front of computers may lead to disadvantages in other arrears of life such as social communications. However, playing computer games for learning and exploring new ideas can be a very effective way to enhance knowledge and imagination for children.

I am on the belief that parents still have authorities on guiding their children at that time as long as it is not too much intervening. I will outline two measures that can be done by parents for guiding their children.\n\nFirst of all, the most important area is safety. Children tend to do something based on what they like but careless on its risks. Likewise, children are more curious than adults that they want to try anything. For instance, in some developing countries like Indonesia, especially in a village, many adolescents ride a motorcycle before they are 15 years old and they do not require a driving license. Commonly, they drive fast and do not wear a helmet. This issue needs parents\u2019 attention. Therefore, parents should give advice and necessary information about the suitable time for them for riding a vehicle.\n\nAnother measure is financial management. In some regions, most teenagers depend on their parents for money. It is my firm belief that guiding them on how to manage money from the young age will be valuable for their future. In addition, children could make a better decision on what their money should be spent on. For example, parents should give a particular amount of money regularly. They have to commit that there will be no extra funding even though it is hard up. Therefore, children\u2019s awareness will go up and the probability of getting a part-time job is highly likely to happen. Proper guidance from parents can build a better future for the children.

Firstly they will lack in physical activities and other works that demand hardworking and strength because they are not having sufficient intake of food to produce energy that is required for such activities. This will make them lethargic and their sedimentary lifestyle contributes to weight gain. Secondly, deficient energy in the body will affect the immune system that would show less resistance against viruses and make the human more open for diseases.\n\nHowever, dieting plays a substantial role in controlling obesity and youngsters are more attracted towards this technique of weight loose. It helps them in reducing weight and also makes their body sound and finally helps them gain a good shape. In addition to this, dieting also helps in proper working of various organisms in the human body, that is also scientifically proved.\n \nTo sum up, I would like to say that dieting has more disadvantages that outweigh its advantages; people with healthy diet and lifestyle spend better life than others.

Developments have led students to spend more time on a variety of electronic communication devices and to become less flexible when it comes to learning lessons at school. However, I personally believe that the overall quality of learning has been fundamentally improved.\n    \nOn one hand, in the past, teaching children was far simpler. One reason is that they did not have any access to other study resources. They had to follow their instructors\u2019 rules to learn from theoretical and practical materials instead of using the Internet. For example, to learn English, students mostly used school laboratories and only listened to materials recommended by their teacher.  Now, students can listen and participate in hundreds of online courses through the web, each with different strategies which often confuse learners.  Another issue is that cyber-addiction has lead children to spend less time studying their basic books. Playing video games, which are upgraded every month, chatting on Facebook or texting friends mean children find less opportunity to study and practice their lessons.\n    \nOn the other hand, some social networks and telecommunication systems are extremely useful to children. The primary factor is online learning which has become a popular method of teaching in many countries. For instance, to learn biology, children can search and find a variety of topics on the web in few seconds, or download their favourite video lessons by paying a very modest amount of money. Tutors, therefore, spend only a few hours teaching the related subjects in school. Furthermore, social networks have assisted pupils in understanding the materials better. Obviously, in many schools, colleges or even universities, students are encouraged to create study groups and participate in discussions, collecting information far more easily than in the past. In particular, at MIT in the USA, students have private accounts and can connect to any other student in the US university system.  This gives them access to a far wider range of materials, ideas and approaches to data than learning in the past.\n    \nIn conclusion, although children had more time to study classroom materials in the past, now they get a better quality of teaching.

However, other individuals believe that students must have a continuous education. It seems reasonable to argue that a year break between secondary and tertiary education is not a reasonable perspective.\n\nPrimarily, it is often said that if a student decided to give himself a one year vacation before pursuing the higher education, he or she might b able to gain work experiences. Obviously, the student can use the experiences once he or she applied as a professional employee in a certain institution. This is because most of employers often seek workers who have numerous work experiences and credentials. Linked to this is the fact that every high school graduate student has encountered the pressure of studying difficult subjects such as geometry and physics. Thus, a year break will give the student a chance to indulge in his or her desired activities. Understandably, the schedule in some high schools consumes most of the students\u2019 time, which could have been spent on relaxation or hobbies.\n\nBesides, the year gap could be used to travel extensively and that would be an excellent opportunity for them to gather firsthand experience about the different cultures and countries. Students who get practical job experience can learn money management and learn to appreciate the value of money. The experience gathered from job and travel often helps them to excel in their academic studies when they start their academic years in university.\n\nHowever, it cannot be denied that students may find it difficult to adjust to the lessons and topics being discussed at the primary level in college. One major reason of this is that the students could forget the knowledge they have learned during their high school days. As can be expected, in college, some professors appear to start at basic subjects, such as algebra and English, in order to help the students adapt to the level of difficulty. In addition to this, the students could be enticed to abandon their studies because they might think that the salaries in their temporary occupations are enough to supplement their financial needs. For instance, some students in the Philippines are attracted by the higher salaries offered in non-skilled jobs, which make them sacrifice their education.\n\nIn conclusion, I am convinced that a year break must not be encouraged to every high school graduate student due to the fact that it may ruin the student\u2019s education.

I agree that governments should allocate a higher budget for education compared to recreation and sports. This can be proven by analysing, how spending more money on education can reduce unemployment rate as well as decrease crime rate and can positively enhance the people\u2019s life standard.\n\nIf more people are educated in a country, it is apparent that the employment rate of that nation will be high, as there are a lot of skilled employments available throughout the world. But to have many people educated, the governments should provide good education system which is affordable by the citizens. For example, as per the report published in the Week magazine during August 2015, America has very less unemployment rate as the government provides best quality education to the citizens at a very minimal fee. Thus, it is obvious that the government should focus on spending more on the education sector. The recreation and sports activities are also important for people but the education has far better importance.\n\nAs the society has more social knowledge, the crime rate will be reduced. This is due to the fact that education creates a positive mentality among the people. For instance, as per the BBC report telecasted on January 2015, Nigeria has a crime rate which is 20 times more than the USA. Therefore it is the responsibility of the governments to ensure that the citizens are educated by providing adequate infrastructure. In addition to that, governments should even make the secondary education free and mandatory. Hence it is very clear that governments must allocate a higher budget for education. Sports and other recreation can improve people\u2019s life standard but what benefits it can bring when the people have poverty and they are engaging in crime?\n\nBy analysing how allocating more money for education can increase employment rate and make the earth a safer place to live, it is very important that governments should allocate a higher percent of the budget on education.

It is quite difficult for a majority of people to alter the state of mind, the way they think and the environment they get used to. Therefore several problems can occur when they are told to do and solve their issues in easier and more decent ways. In my opinion, obvious solutions knock the door of psychologists and also family members and relatives should act in these positions. Changes in some cases are inevitable and embracing the new idea and way of life bring many opportunities and hence accepting new things are often not options, but mandatory for us.\n\nIn modern life, people adjust to different habits and routines and then they do not tend to get involved to change their usual activities. By doing this, they decline any other offer presented by surroundings, especially when these offers are from ones that they do not like. Because of that their resistance increases in not changing. For example, when a parent asked their kid to not do disobedience or not eat chocolate too much, this kid's persistence in the matter sometimes enhances as far as parents ask. That's why the worst and most difficult of the problem is the resistance of children's unruly behaviour. If these issues are not undertaken by someone responsible and coped with the problem, its consequences stay to the rest of child's life vitally.\n\nNew ideas, technology and changes are often for better ways of life. Not being able to grip the new idea and changes can bring personal and social problems. Parents who cannot embrace the idea of modernization and generation gaps often have bitter experience with their children. Changes in society are also natural with time and the old way life will not remain forever. New ideas often come to people with open and broader perspective. Old traditions have their importance but new customs, ideas and changes should also be accepted for the overall betterment of the society.\n\nA healthy family and social relationship, use of technology, guidance and mutual understanding people of different generations can minimise this problem to a great extent. It is natural that old people will not easily accept the radical changes of ideas, values and way of life. New generations should talk to them, discuss them and present the good sides of the changes they have accepted.\n\nTo conclude, it is best to consult these overwhelming behaviours to an expert for the sake of the welfare of both the people and the society.

As injuries and accidents at work have been frequently reported, the government set some policies about safety at work, which covers so many aspects. One of the examples is that heavy industry companies should provide their workers with the appropriate safety equipment, as the risk of being injured at work is high in this industry. In another example, drivers of special vehicles such as bulldozer or forklift must have a registered certificate or a special license, as driving these vehicles requires special techniques.\n \nIf I have the authority to set some regulations about safety, I would set these kinds of policies. Firstly, every company should make a report about health, safe and green environment in their workplace.

Secondly, there would be a regulation about safety audit. The government should set some audit teams, which will inspect companies\u2019 safety environment during their work hour. Companies with unsatisfactory audit result must be reassessed during the renewal of their business licenses. By having these two policies, it is hoped that companies will implement a safe and healthy working environment in their workplace.\n\nIn conclusion, I strongly agree that safety at work is an important thing, as many governments have set some specific rules about it.

I completely agree with the statement that television cannot replace the book as a learning tool as it is far less educative and far more addictive.\n\nFirstly, television cannot replace books as learning materials owing to the fact that children often misuse television in the disappearance of parents. For instance, educative programs are less attractive than the cartoon shows and other programs children prefer to watch. While there are lots of educative and suitable programs, it is not unusual that a child would prefer to watch programs that entertain more than educating.\n\nAnother reason television is not as suitable as a book because when children learn through television then their focus will be on audio-visual presentation, not in learning. Whereas if they follow books then they focus on books and the lessons it offers.\n\nIt is often heard that many children watch TV for long hours and that is detrimental to their health. Television programs are addictive and many children do not concentrate on other important things like study or outdoor activity when they become addicted to watching TV programs.\n\nFinally, television cannot replace the book as learning tool due to television might be a tool that would be wastage of time.  However, if children spend more time in reading books there is no chance of wastage of time. The primary focus of television is entertaining people while books are considered as the cornerstone of knowledge and wisdom.\n\nTo conclusion, although television is more entertaining than books, it cannot become a great tool for education as books are for children.

While the former offers a hectic lifestyle and have much more pollution, the latter grants a tranquil and favourable environment for our physical and psychological benefits. I completely agree with this viewpoint for several reasons.\n\nFirstly, almost all big cities have an intolerable level of air, sound and environmental pollutions primarily due to the increasing number of vehicles, carbon emission, wastages of industries, metro facilities and amenities for a modern lifestyle. On top of that, the population density in big cities is much higher, and it creates an unhealthy living standard in many parts. Finally, people in big cities often rely on processed food as they are busy. This unhealthy food habit, along with pollution, emerges as a serious threat to their health in the long run.  For instance, more than 60 per cent of school students in large municipalities in developing countries are exposed to a higher level of air and sound pollutions and eat junk food which severely affects their physical and mental health.\n\nSecondly, it is generally known that stresses in metropolises are considerably higher due to many factors. One of the main factors is the long working hours. Secondly, living costs in big cities are high. Although people earn higher in metro areas, their salaries, oftentimes, do not meet their needs and expectations, which adversely impact their psychology. Long working hours combined with severe traffic jam consume their time and they have little time left to spend with their families.\n\nTo conclude, it is inevitable that pollution, stresses and unhealthy food jeopardize people\u2019s health in big cities, and this is why it is justified to state that living in large cities is damaging for people's well-being.", "original_link": "https://www.ielts-mentor.com/writing-sample/writing-task-2/2238-living-in-big-cities-is-bad-for-peoples-health"}, {"essay_topic": "Some people believe that exploring outer space is important because it expands human knowledge and might lead to discoveries that will benefit humanity in the future.

People seems like cannot find a successful path due to stress related problem. Mentally disturbed one have problems in each and every step of the life. In my opinion, people should have stress but not across the inordinate level of stress in day to day life. Higher competition, higher expenses, limited resources, more expectation and globalizations are the main reasons for this increased stress in our life. Having realistic ambitions in life, living a positive life, better family bonding and being honest and contended are the main ways of overcoming this problem.   \n\nI believe that higher competition in every step of life is the most common reason for our stress. I believed that the stress has taken place into our mind due to the lack of our self-confidence. Main reason behind the stress is to not having a clear vision towards foreseeable future. Many people could not anticipate their aim and objectives in life. Mostly people who are always jumbling for their destinations tend to face stress in day to day activities. A person in stress neither gets an opportunity in life nor live the life happily. People in stress just waste their time for blaming others for their problem. Higher living expenses force people to work more and that has reached to over 10-14 hours in many professions. Limited resources and the higher population have made it impossible to have a decent life without competing. This is another reason people nowadays face more job-related stress than ever before. Many people are not contented with whatever they have and they are always in stress. Globalisation has opened the doors of new possibility and along with it new expectations. This is another reason that can be contributed to the stress. The environment pollution and junk food that we usually eat reduced our level of fitness and physical illness and mental stress are correlated.Again, frustration and depression are the reasons for mental stress for people and drug abuse, family issues and social perspectives could be attributed to these. Stress decreases the efficiency of people on job. People with such pressure also fail to manage good relationship within home and outside.

According to an official survey, children's educational toys can allow their cognitive development to be effective and faster. The following paragraphs are going to discuss the pros and cons for children having lots of playthings or toys.\n \nApparently, providing a wider range of toys to children to play with can benefit their psychological developments. The best toys engage a child's senses, spark their imaginations and encourage them to interact with others. For example, Lego blocks can help preschoolers to learn letters, numbers and languages skills. Moreover, it can improve their communication skill as well when they play with other kids. As everyone knows, communication plays an essential role in our life and the toys can help them have playmates with whom they communicate a lot. Finally, some toys are made for children's educational purposes. For example, blocks, educational computer games, puzzles etc. ignite the creativity of children and let them find out their interests.\n \nNevertheless, other people propose that the argument above is merely a one sided story as children having too many playthings become greedy. For instance, many parents spoil their children by purchasing every toy the children want. Afterwards, those children will have a strong desire to acquire more toys. Moreover, those toys need a plenty of money and wasting is an evil act. Furthermore, too many toys may grow a conformist mentality in a child as they are immature to distinguish the good from the bad and they just follow other children's playing style, activity and characters. Finally, if a child gets every toy he wants, he will not value most of the toys and lose his interests on a toy and would like to have a new toy. Thus the true need of toys is misused by purchasing a lot of toys to the children.\n \nIn conclusion, toys play an important role in helping a child's growth but too many toys affect children's psychological development negatively. Thus parents should lead them in a proper way and purchase a reasonable number of toys that they would feel right for their children.\n\n[ Written by \u2013 Shirley ]\n ", "original_link": "https://www.ielts-mentor.com/writing-sample/writing-task-2/2201-ielts-writing-task-2-sample-1015-advantages-and-disadvantages-for-the-child-of-having-a-large-number-of-toys"}, {"essay_topic": "A gift (such as a camera, a soccer ball, or an animal) can contribute to a child\u2019s development.

In some rural areas which are not developed, women still take up only the role of mothers. They may not be well educated and therefore cannot support themselves.

However, it is easier when the stores are under the market authority in a single building.

Thus, small businesses do not have a wide appeal to people and nor do financially help local government.\n\n\nIn conclusion, to conform to modern shoppers' demand and facilities, mega malls are emerging.

Firstly, they provide a single platform to customers where they can purchase everything they need, ranging from groceries to clothing and more. Consequently, they do not have to make multiple stops at different stores to get the needful, hence, making shopping extraordinarily convenient. Secondly, they offer a number of facilities including car parking, toilets, deli counters, resting areas to make shopping a more comfortable and fun experience. Thus, pulling more and more customers and multiplying the business.\n\nAs more people opt to shop at supermarkets, local businesses suffer loss and eventually shut down. However, that, in no way, result in local communities' death. Today's customers are resourceful and educated. They have the means of transportation and time to go to supermarkets as shopping has transformed into entertainment. Convenience stores, on the other hand, still have a chance to survive by relocating to an area where there is enough clientage. All in all, local communities can travel to supermarkets just fine and can easily survive in the absence of local convenience stores.\n\nIn conclusion, supermarkets have given local businesses a tough time. In my opinion, local stores can relocate to carry on and even if they do not, local communities will survive by shopping at supermarkets because they are capable of doing so.\n\n[Written by - Shahzada Robin]", "original_link": "https://www.ielts-mentor.com/writing-sample/writing-task-2/2157-large-shopping-malls-are-replacing-small-shops"}, {"essay_topic": "Some people think that cities are the best places to live.

In this essay, I will examine the reasons for this trend and suggest some practical policies the authorities could implement to reduce the level of traffic in our cities.\n\nThe first step is to understand why traffic has increased in towns and cities. Broadly speaking, there are three main reasons for this. One is that cars have become more affordable for the average consumers and they are no longer a luxury item, but something that most families expect to own. A second reason is that public transport has become increasingly unreliable in recent years, not least because many bus and train services have been reduced because of the difficulty in funding them. The third reason is that society has, in general, become more mobile and this means more people are prepared to commute to work by car than they were before.\n\nThe biggest causes of traffic jam lack of proper road and bridges in cities. If there is an additional way for buses and large trucks in cities, traffic jams reduce in cities.\n\nThere is almost certainly no one solution to this problem given the complexity of its causes. However, one option has to be to improve the reliability of public transport to encourage people to take the bus or the train rather than get in the car. It would also be possible to discourage people from driving to work by introducing special tariffs for using the roads, especially during peak periods.\n\nIn conclusion, there are a variety of different factors that have led to rising levels of traffic in urban areas. While it may not be possible to find a complete solution but actions should probably involve encouraging more use of public transports.Furthermore, taxes on private cars should be increased and eco-friendly transportation like bicycles should be promoted.[ Written by - Togrul Nesirli ]", "original_link": "https://www.ielts-mentor.com/writing-sample/writing-task-2/2140-ielts-writing-task-2-sample-977-in-cities-and-towns-all-over-the-world-the-high-volume-of-traffic-is-a-problem"}, {"essay_topic": "International entertainers, including sports personalities, often get paid millions of dollars in one year.

What are the reasons for this? What can employers do to help employees?", "extra_topic": "", "model_answer": "\nThe ever increasing job competition, the pressure of constant deadlines, the technological dependency in jobs and people\u2019s expectation to thrive in the workplace have changed the definition of professional life and most of the employees require to work harder and for long hours each day. In this essay, I will examine the reasons behind this work pressure and lengthy working hours and suggest some ways that the employers can help improve the condition.\n\nHigh competition in the job market is one of the reasons why jobs have become such stressful these days. Employers always have options for finding new employees and replace someone and this is why someone who has already been hired has to work hard to save his job. This naturally has negative psychological effects on employees. Employees have to work for longer hours to meet their performance target as the invisible threat of firing is there. Increasing competition caused by globalisation is another reason to make the workplace such stressful. Many small and medium business entities need to compete with other multinational companies and companies in developing nations where labour price is cheaper. The effect of this on employees is that they know they may be made redundant if the business they work for fails. This force the employees not only to work longer hours but also suffer from work-related stress and uncertainty. In most of the organisations, the employers these days set targets for the employees and most of the targets are hard to achieve. As a result, employees are forced to work beyond 10 hours per day and even on days-off. Finally, people\u2019s expectation from the offices have reached to a higher position and people are ready to sacrifice their personal life for the sake of promotions. This shift of mind setup has also attributed to the increasing work pressure.\n\nDespite the higher competition in business, employers should ensure a healthy working environment and support their workers morally and financially in order to sustain in the long run. An organisation cannot survive without experiences and dedicated employees and constant fear of uncertainty cannot ensure a healthy workplace. Employers should encourage employees to work the regular hours and work overtime only when it is absolutely necessary. The employers should also encourage people who perform better and award them for their performance. The workers should be allowed to take breaks and should not suffer from anxiety of losing jobs. Finally, the employers should have a friendly relationship with the workers and have meetings to listen to their problem. If the employer can assure the employees that they are ready to help each other and their jobs are secured, they can then expect better outputs from the employees.\n\nIn conclusion, higher competition in the job market, globalisation and people\u2019s aim to reach higher are the main reasons for stress in the workplace and the employers have a lot to contribute to improving this situation. A healthy workplace is very crucial for the best performance by the employees.

Besides, the traditional belief of educating a boy and upbringing a girl so that he becomes the breadwinner and she can become a good housewife is no longer accepted by the modern era. The traditional belief of fixed role for men and women are no longer applicable to this advance era where people believe in gender equity. Furthermore, the modern generation no longer agrees to take the fact that a student has to study to become either a doctor or an engineer.

In my opinion, though life seems to be challenging as we grow old, we could make it happier by making use our cognitive progression in our adult life.\n\nOn the one side, most people are of opinion that year after year, our lives get complicated. According to them, during our teenage and adolescence period, we are not carried away by worries related to family, finance and responsibilities, but as we grow older, issues like fetching a job, earning, saving, looking after our parents and children become a millstone on our shoulders. Another significant reason cited for why ageing is problematic is the age-related disorders causing physical ailments like knee and joint pains, eye problems and indigestion.\n\nOn the flip side, some people believe that ageing makes life more fruitful. They are inclined to a strong point that a man gets moulded at every stage of life and it is an essential improvement. Being immature and without worries doesn\u2019t actually define happiness, they claim. Rather, every individual could use their natural boons such as intelligent quotient and emotional quotient as an aid to tactically solve the hurdles on their way. For instance, while we have a headache or fever, we might not know what to do during our younger ages but as we grow old we learn to take antibiotics or go to a physician. In the same way, every issue could be sorted out by everyone and life could be made happier. The freedom of decision making is a big difference in childhood and grownup time. When you grow older, you become the earning member and thus you have more freedom to take decisions. On the contrary, in childhood we rely on our parents earning and hence they take most of our decision and obliged us to follow their wish.  \n\nTo conclude, the older we become, the happier we are by exploring the world and by taking up responsibilities and this is facilitated by the maturity factor of ageing.\nSo, we need to move on with life happily.\n\n[ Written by - Nivetha Subramanian ]", "original_link": "https://www.ielts-mentor.com/writing-sample/writing-task-2/2126-ielts-writing-task-2-sample-970-the-older-you-get-life-becomes-more-complicated"}, {"essay_topic": "Today the world has many urgent problems and solving them is possible by nations\u2019 cooperation.", "extra_topic": "", "model_answer": "\nGlobalisation, the buzzword of the modern era, has tremendously positive and negative impacts on today\u2019s world.

The focus of this essay is to scrutinise the problems and solutions by economic and social perspectives and rule out the writer's opinion.\n\nFirst and foremost, from the economic point of view, half of the world is facing a major financial crisis. Financial equilibrium around the world could only be possible with the help of developed countries. Very often underdeveloped countries export their natural resources in cheapest rate for costly technical products and thus fall into debt. To be clear, to resolve these debts country takes loans from World Bank and this continues as a cycle. These kinds of financial burden can be reduced by taking natural resource in the good rate by developed nations.\n\nSecondly, when the problems are taken in social perspectives, it is huge in number.

Hence a global bonding and cooperation to solve such urgent issues are required. The developed countries as well as the developing and under developed countries can all work together to reduce the air and environmental pollution of the world.

The essence of their rights is the existence the welfare and security service. For example, the government should provide general practitioners who look after all the health issues of a family for each family.

There are several reasons for this; such as addiction to digital gadgets and the desire to acquire materialistic prosperity. It is undeniable that this trend has serious impacts on every single person and the community as a whole.\n\nAt the outset, there are two main causes for the gradual waning of hobbies these days. Firstly, the revolutionised digital era makes people as couch potatoes in front of laptops, smartphones, the internet and social media. So obviously the citizens become less interested in carrying out an activity apart from these. Secondly, In an aspiration to achieve materialistically prosperous, they extend their working hours thereby cutting down the time spent on hobbies. For example, my uncle who has been a passionate cyclist for years hardly does cycling after being placed in one of the top multinational companies.\n\nIncidentally, the above reasons have detrimental effects on the masses. The most significant impact on the individuals is the reduction in the physical activity. This would lead them to an unbalanced lifestyle; thereby making them the victims of diseases like high blood pressure, obesity, high cholesterol and heart attacks. This is because of the deposition of fats in the body which might naturally cause obesity after a period of time. Another connected effect is the loss of productivity in the workplace even after working for hours and hours together since the employees would deprive of ways to channelize their stress.\n\nTo conclude, the contemporary changes like digital addiction and work stress has lessened the time spent for hobbies.

As per the statistics in the report, if the people utilise only 60% of the public transports then the pollution will reduce to 40% in metro cities. Thus, denizen must support the initiatives by travelling via public transportations.\n\nIn addition, public transports have generic dustbins to support the rubbish while travel, which may not be possible in private cars. For an example, if people commute by personal vehicles they will throw out the rubbish outside on the road, which will cause the pollution and sometimes even block the sewage system of the city. For an instance, recent sewage blockage in Mumbai, India was on account of rubbish blocking the pathway. Thus, commuting with government vehicle will assist in controlling of rubbish and assist legislators in reducing the pollution.\n\nTo draw the conclusion, in the view of mitigating issues of global warming and rubbish packages on the roads, people must travel by public transport and make earth a better place to live in.[ Written by - Anshuman Mishra ]", "original_link": "https://www.ielts-mentor.com/writing-sample/writing-task-2/2111-ielts-writing-task-2-sample-961-people-should-use-public-transport-to-support-pollution-control-initiatives"}, {"essay_topic": "Excessive population increase is raising the pressure on earth.

It can be ascribed to the lack of parental supervision and the negative influences of peers. However, this social problem can be tackled by the employers and parents.\n\nPrimarily, is it often said that youngsters may opt to negative vices if parents do not monitor their activities. Evidently, there are parents who have a hectic schedule in their workplace, thus neglecting the responsibilities to their children. Because of inadequate guidance, these youngsters socialise with other people in the society. For instance, in school, children develop a relationship with their friends as it is considered their second home. A group of friends shares the same habits and passions such as venturing to illegal substances and criminal behaviours. It might be their way to retaliate to their parents, who do not spend time with them. These children may eel resentment due to the fact that they might have the feeling of being unloved and unwanted. Therefore, they will perform nefarious actions such that they will gain the attention of their parents, and make them regretful for being preoccupied to their employment.\n\nHowever, it can never be denied that this social dilemma can be addressed by the parents and the employers. First of all, parents can give more attention to their children by having a weekly family outing to different places.

The modern world has changed this perspective to a great extent despite some people\u2019s old-fashioned views that a woman should look after the family and a man should be the bread winner. In my view, gender equality is far more important than considering which sectors are more suitable for a particular gender and which are not.\n \nSome people might present traditional arguments regarding the suitability of some posts for females and some others for male, but the modern era teaches us otherwise. In fact, greater freedom of choice in terms of employment can accelerate the development of a nation than the old way of distributed work pattern. For instance, it is believed by many that a female is more suitable for a profession that requires tenderness and caring while men are more adept in doing tasks those demand more physical strength. Thus, according to their opinion, more women should become nurses or teachers than males while logging, mining, and construction works should be solely done by males.\n\n\nHowever, making occupations more open to both genders have distinctive advantages and in certain cases, mixed-gender work environment outperforms the single-sex workplace. For instance, having an all-female hospital is quite challenging and not a pragmatic idea at all. Men and women can bring diverse perspectives and approaches to a job and a school with both male and female teachers has better teaching environment than a single-sex-teacher one. It is quite logical that a female patient would feel more comfortable to consult with a female doctor while a female police would better understand the domestic violence and bring superior strategies for dealing with the problems. Though traditional view does not support women to become doctors or police, we can definitely understand their needs.\n\n\nTo conclude, innovation and advantages the gender equality in job sectors can bring is far-reaching and have greater benefits for the society.

Classrooms are accommodating a considerable number of students which is quite problematic for faculty members to reserve time for each and every student considering the difficulty level of educational studies and quantity of time required if they try to allocate it for each individual. These problems can be resolved substantially if educational management distributes all students into groups and allocate separate days for students who are weak or the ones who cannot understand easily. Further, the state should be responsible in the long term to establish and develop more and more educational institutions to cater and serve rising educational needs.Firstly, the school/college authorities should divide all the pupils into groups by keeping in view the previous examination results so that in each group there could be a blend of high IQ and average IQ students. For instance, the high achievers can help and teach the weak students in their group to keep up with the studies. The authorities can announce some sought of incentives for all these top scorers in the form of scholarships.

Although there are strong arguments that support this perspective, I strongly believe that it is not reasonable to restrict tobacco smoking in the society.\n\nPrimarily, it is evident that restraining those cigarette consumers from smoking can cause withdrawal symptoms. This cigarette has an addictive substance called nicotine that leads to the feeling of euphoria for the users. For instance, a chain smoker will become uncomfortable if they cannot smoke at least one stick of cigarette. Thereby, they become depressed and lethargic as their bodies are highly dependent on a substance which alters the mood. This often seems to affect their well-being such concentration and decision making since smoking exalts their body to become more active.\n\nFurthermore, there are reasons to suggest that tobacco products will relocate to the black market as they are made illegitimate in the society. If the consumers purchase this product in illegal merchandise, they might be tempted to patronise other dangerous substance such as Cocaine and Marijuana. Black market offers nefarious goods available for those people who are unsatisfied with the products sold in the public market. As a result, the incidence of crimes may escalate due to the fact that substance can create inhibitions, which make the intoxicated people irrational about their actions. To illustrate, they could do heinous things as they might see as they are not aware of their morality.\n\nLastly, it can never be denied that it is the right of every individual to smoke. It would be a breach of their personal decision to smoke cigarettes if the government banned these products. It is possible that these people might resent the higher authority because they are the one who spends their salary on cigarettes, not the government officials. Hence, they will retaliate such as building a riot or promoting a democratic amendment to the government.\n\nTo conclude, I am convinced that cigarette should not be eradicated in public merchandises as there are people who are dependent on these products.

There are several positive outcomes behind this trend and a considerable number of potential drawbacks.\n \nPrimarily, it could be argued that in some large scale commercial establishments, there are a variety of selections about personal commodities such as clothing, shoes, and bags. There is a view that well-developed shops have to increase the supply of their products because some small commercial establishment cannot provide the entire goods to the public. Taking into consideration the local store which has a limited supply of personal goods in a remote area, it seems apparent that some store owners have paucity in the investment of commercial goods, thus they cannot maximise the supply and demand of their business. Furthermore, it is often claimed that there is an amenable price in some more affluent shopping centres that some developing merchandises. Many people consider that there is an additional cost for some products available in the local store due to some owners who procure the supply of their shop to other large distributors of goods. For instance, the store keeper will gain a higher profitable income if they obtain some products to some higher commercial distributors, which sell cheap consumer goods. As a result, there will be an advantage for local store keepers.\n\nIn contrast, it can never be denied that there are negative effects of opting to large shops.

In the wake of education with travelling, the majority of institutions have included sight visiting as a predominant determinant while designing a course. Some people believe learning by seeing is propitious for scholars; however, other claims the opposite. I will discuss both the sides in the viability of the argument and state an opinion.\n\nOn the one hand, opponents of adding travelling in education claim that it will hinder students to excel academically. Firstly, subjects like Mathematics, Physics and Information Technology do not require a pupil to see a sight or travel to learn them. For an example, if someone wants to be a mathematician, he must be excellent in mathematical skills and travelling to places will not add value for such students in learning and assimilating scientific concepts. Therefore, travelling has no importance in learning these subjects. Secondly, the exchange program to learn can act as a hinder in learning, as every country will have its own set of educational standards, which may not be suitable for every student. Thus, many contend that adding travelling in the curriculum is not viable and beneficial for scholars.\n\nOn the other hand, proponents of assimilating travelling as a determinant in learning claim various rationales in support of the opinion. One the most profuse reason is on account of learning associated with practical knowledge. These advocates also assert that practical learning by sightseeing inculcates a permanent learning among the scholars, which is mandatory for the overall development of students. It can be confirmed by the latest report of education society of India, which has published the statistics of experiments on students. As per experiment, pupils were divided into two groups and taught a lesson in two different ways, the first group was taught theoretically and another group was taught practically by showing the actual sight. As per results, children taught using sightseeing were able to retain the information for 20 days extra than the students educated theoretically. Likewise, students can learn more if they will travel to other countries. It will not only impart an impetus to their academic learning, but also it will infuse cross-cultural understanding. Consequently, it will enhance the overall growth of students.\n\nTo sum up, after discussing both sides of the argument, I am convinced that advantages of adding travelling in education overweigh the disadvantages and it must be encouraged for the overall academic and social development of the scholars.[ Written by - Anshuman Mishra ]", "original_link": "https://www.ielts-mentor.com/writing-sample/writing-task-2/2077-ielts-writing-task-2-sample-935-should-travelling-be-included-in-the-education"}, {"essay_topic": "Some practical skills such as money management should be taught in high school.", "extra_topic": "", "model_answer": "\nHigh School is the high time when teenagers put their first step towards independence.

The two key reasons why organic products are the best are they have fewer pesticides and more nutrients.\n\nThe conventional fruits and vegetables look more convincing in the stores. It is usually cheaper and good looking that catches buyers. While organic fruits are sad looking which have holes and spots or rotten part, they offer better food value.

It is often claimed that some factories have adopted the use of machines in manufacturing products such as appliances and cell phones, therefore they can hasten the reproduction but with low quality.

Why does this happen? How does this affect society?", "extra_topic": "", "model_answer": "\nEver since the genesis of industrialisation, the world has gone through many paradigm shifts.  This is also evident in the fact that average family size is getting smaller. It is argued that rising costs of living and career-oriented thinking are the primary reasons for this trend. These causes and their effects will be analysed in this essay\n\nTo begin, ever since the industrial revolution, rising cost of living in cities has compelled people to shrink the size of their families due to economic reasons. This has resulted in families spending more time with their offspring, since the number of children, among which parents have to divide their time, has reduced dramatically. For example, a recent study conducted by Save the Children, a not for profit organisation, found that children of the modern era do much better than their earlier counterparts in schools and colleges. This would perhaps not be possible if parents had to spend a large amount of their time nurturing the needs of a higher number of children. Hence, the impact a small family size has on child\u2019s academics is clear.\n\nIn addition, the advent of technology has removed the need for human intervention in many jobs, as a consequence, now more people have to compete for fewer jobs. Such circumstances have made people more career oriented than they used to be, therefore, starting and expansion of families has moved to the bottom of the pecking order of many people\u2019s priorities. The most evident effect of this on society is an ageing population in many of the western countries in the world. For instance, in Germany, the population growth rate is in negative, which could perhaps mean that the current generation of Germany will not be able to replace their dying forefathers in numbers. Therefore the devastating impact of small families is also evident.\n\nAs is clear, improved academic performances of children on the one hand and the probable extinction of genes of some, on the other hand, are the two of most prominent impacts of decreasing family sizes.

There are arguments to suggest that people should live in a traditional form of lifestyle to rectify ecological problems. However, it can be argued that the technology can offer solutions to tackle the environmental destruction.\n\nPrimarily, it is indubitable that the natural habitat could be preserved if most people adapted to manual labour rather than machines. It might be the case that some farmers use mechanical ploughs, which emits a considerable amount of fumes, to weed their farm. There is a view that these machines, which hasten the productivity, have helped people from their daily routine task. As a result, the demand of machines will also lead to the production of carbon dioxide, which will contribute to global warming.  Furthermore, there are reasons to suggest that some of the machines have been used to exploit environmental resources. Taking into consideration the use of the chain saw that accelerates the logging of live trees. It is also possible that some businessmen have established factories, and most of the equipment is reliant on fossil fuel. In the previous era, majority of primitive people have survived even without the use of technology, thus in this modern world, some would consider that people can still thrive by reducing the usage of machines.\n\nIn contrast, it can never be denied that the advent of technology has contributed to the development of a country and even the preservation of mother earth can be granted by modern studies. To illustrate, there is a feasible study6 that asserts that the ultraviolet rays coming from the sun can be prevented through the use of mirrors which will b flown in the space. As a result, the sun rays will be deflected by the million of mirrors in the space, and that will be viable because of the continuous development in technology. In addition, the possibility to recycle the old goods and rubbish has become realistic because of the application of technology. For instance, the disintegration of matter and moulding to a new form can be ascribed to advances in machinery and computers.\n\nIn my opinion, time is inevitably progressing, and people need to adapt to the modern culture. Moreover, there has been as strict legislation that precludes people from abusing the environmental resource, thus they might seldom use technology to harm the forest.\n\nTo conclude, some people believe that they should not become more reliant on machines in order to maintain the wealth of the environment, yet it is compelling that technology has been proven to produce amenable aid to resolve the environmental hazards and pollution.[ Written by - Chino Bouquets ]", "original_link": "https://www.ielts-mentor.com/writing-sample/writing-task-2/2071-ielts-writing-task-2-sample-930-modern-technology-has-a-great-impact-on-our-environment"}, {"essay_topic": "People nowadays are not fit and active than the people from the olden days.

Sports, which is played among nations, is one such event which is becoming extremely popular, especially among the youngsters of the developed nations. The discussion that whether or not to host an international sporting program by a nation is advantageous is a debatable one, with strong logics provided by the supporters of both the views.\n\nOn the one hand, a sense of patriotism will be increased among the citizens of the hosting country due to the fact that they will be proud to see their country in the international headlines, during the entire event. In addition to that, the nation's top leaders have an opportunity to hand over the price to the winners. For example, in 2005 when Brazil hosted the soccer world cup, every day the name 'Brazil' was seen in almost all media like newspapers, televisions and the internet. Secondly, motivation will be cultivated among the youths of the host country, and will actively try to play the game locally. This can bring up the sporting potential of the citizens and later help to play for the nation. For instance, the proportion of citizens playing cricket increased by 10 percent after India hosted cricket world cup in 2000. Thus, a country can have many sportsmen in the pool and pick the best ones.\n\nOn the other hand, there are security threats especially from the terrorists or by opponents from the start to the end of the program. A lot of money needs to be spent to deploy the military forces, round the clock, to ensure that the nation is completely under control. In 2005, Brazil spent 25 million dollars to ensure that the country is secure in all aspects. Moreover, this money could be used for the starving people, especially in Africa. Thus, some people gravitate towards this point of view.\n\nIn conclusion, although I understand that huge money needs to be spent for safety purposes, I totally agree that hosting international sporting events are advantageous for both - the hosting country and the attending countries.

While some people believe that smoking and drinking alcohol do not have that much detriment effect on health and should be sold freely, I firmly believe that smoking and alcohol are drugs that lead to health problems and addiction and, as a result, they should be prohibited.\n\nFirst of all, tobacco is a silent killer not only for smokers but also for people around. Smoking is known as a cause of more than 25 different deadly diseases including lung cancer, bronchitis and emphysema. According to the recent statistics, four million people around the world die yearly from tobacco-related diseases - one death every eight seconds. Tobacco is significantly becoming a greater cause of death and disability than any other single cause. Therefore, smoking cigarettes is a huge global threat and should be illegal. The number of female and young smokers is increasing globally and completely banning cigarettes could be an effective measure to enhance public health. The amount of money a country spend each year to treat people who suffer from tobacco-related diseases could be better utilised to treat other patients.   \n\nThe next point that needs to be taken into consideration is alcohol that has already become a serious problem during the last centuries. More and more people use alcohol every day and sometimes not only a glass of wine during the evening but also far more than usual. As a result, this group of people becomes unhealthy. Moreover, drinking too much alcohol can lead to more serious problems such as brain damage and even can cause a separation with the partner and break a family. Moreover, children struggle a lot from drunkard parents. Therefore, alcohol should be banned globally. The negative health and social problems the alcohol creates are enormous and the banning it will bring more social stability, morality and better life expectancy.  \n\nTo sum up, from my point of view, cigarettes and alcohol are two greatest threats to the society and our health.

The online newspaper or book can be immediately updated or revised by their editors from their servers, therefore readers will always get the latest news. And then, it is easier to purchase online literature as people would just open their gadgets, log in and insert their credit card numbers, and they could get new articles.\n\nOn the other hand, although several people think that printed media are old fashioned, but certain people prefer to buy these outdated versions. Firstly, they believe that reading print out versions is better that online ones because they have fewer side effects to the eyes.

Secondly, a lot of people prefer to buy the hardcopy version, because they like to collect them.

While they had to take responsibility for home duties far more than males, now their roles in the workforce has become more obvious. Some individuals might disagree with it; however, I personally believe that both genders must equally be permitted to participate in different careers.\n\nOn the one hand, the role of women was mostly catering for their children and related duties of home, and some say that this was extremely important to societies. One obvious benefit was that their children were more under control than now. Mothers had more time to raise their children and had sufficient control over their children\u2019s behaviour, while unfortunately now they are more involved in their job and have less opportunity to have a close relationship with them. Another advantage was that this could have a positive influence on couples\u2019 relationships, and the rate of successful marriage partners was far higher than now.

One important factor behind it is that they are and will be more talented in different fields of jobs because they are more prosperous workers or scientists.

However, others disagree with the statement, as they think that each individual should be responsible for his or her own health and education. The following essay will discuss both views in details.\n\nOn the one hand, many people believe that it is the government's responsibility to provide standard health care and decent education to their people. As people have paid income taxes, property taxes, value added taxes and other kinds of fees to the government, these funds should also be beneficial for the people as well. Some portions of the budget should be allocated to fund medical activities and educational programs. Having a lot of educated and healthy residents brings many benefits for the government, as there are a lot of skill and productive labours in the country who would develop the country's economic sector.    \n\nOn the other hand, some people believe that health and education is a personal matter as it is the responsibility of each individual to maintain own their health and education. They disagree if education and healthcare should be funded from the taxes. They think that it is unfair because some people might be working hard and paid a large amount of taxes, but others might be indolent or jobless and get the same benefits from the government. Therefore they believe that healthcare and education should be standalone institutions, and each people should pay for getting a good education and maintaining their own health.\n\nIn conclusion, to a certain point, I would agree that it is the government's task to provide education and healthcare for their people, as some poor people might not be able to get a good education and decent healthcare.

For the past years, it introduced latest models to the public market. It is agreed that some people will always want to buy the newest model a technology has to offer for reasons such as happiness, passion about new technology, status, getting advanced features and socialisation. These reasons will now be analysed.\n\nFor one, many people want to purchase new things for happiness. For example, my boyfriend has given me the latest iPhone 6 plus from the apple company. It has always been my dream to have this and so this gave the ultimate happiness I have never experienced in my entire life. This makes it clear that buying new products will make people satisfied.\n\nIn addition to this, it makes people more sociable. For instance, with the apple iPhone 6 plus my loved one has given me, I can now connect to my friends and relatives whether here in the Philippines or abroad through using Facebook, Integra and yahoo messenger accounts anytime and anywhere. It is obvious from this that buying new technology will make people sociable.\n\nNew technology always comes with advanced features and people want the best tools to do their tasks. For example, a new computer or laptop comes with more storage capacity and other advancement and facilities that often allure a person to buy the latest model though s/he already has one.\nPeople often purchase new models of technological devices as part of their status. For instance, someone who has a car that completely satisfies the needs of this person would want to buy the latest model always. They prefer status over needs.\n\nIn conclusion, for reasons like being happy, advanced technology, more features, ease of use, passion and more sociable, people want the latest products advanced technology has to offer.

Why could this be? Should governments give more financial support to local film industries?", "extra_topic": "", "model_answer": "\nIn many countries, especially in developing countries, foreign movies are more popular than the locally made films. There are several reasons for this trend and the government can and should greatly contribute to promoting domestic movies for the overall progress of the industry.\n\nThe main reason people prefer movies from other countries is the quality of the movie. It is often noticed that locally made films in many countries lack better plots and the characters do not have the necessary depth to touch the hearts of the audiences. Moreover, foreign films have a great variation and they are more enjoyable than the domestic films. This happens because large film industries like the Hollywood can allocate a huge budget and have talented producers and directors while films made in developing countries have a small amount to spend on a movie and do not have many talented movie makers. For instance, the type of animated movies and special effects developing countries produce these days are unimaginable in most of the developing countries and this is why movie lovers from these countries prefer to watch movies made in other countries. The poor quality of acting and low-budget filmmaking in most of the developing countries discourage the audiences to enjoy local films.\n\n\nIn my opinion, the government should support the film industry in order to support this industry, encourage people to enjoy more domestically produced films and gain international acclimation for quality movies. Each country has some talented producers, actors and filmmakers who for the lack of financial and political support cannot bring out the best. They should be given a chance to prove themselves. No doubt big budget is required to make better quality films and the government should provide subsidiary to help local film industry progress. Government\u2019s help for the movie industry would bring more audiences to the theatre to enjoy those films and earn more ticket money. Moreover, quality films would compete in international stages and bring fame for the country.\n\n\nIn conclusion, the film industry in each country should be supported by the government as it would make local films popular and earn money and fame for the country.

Why this is so and what effects does it bring?", "extra_topic": "", "model_answer": "\nTraffic congestion is one of the most serious problems in big cities and it has made people\u2019s lives more difficult. Thirty years ago, there were fewer cars on the street and people did not suffer from traffic. Today, however, streets are full of cars, buses and trucks. This essay will analyse the most important causes of traffic congestion and will explain the effects of it.\n\nSeveral factors have contributed to the problem of traffic in big cities. The most significant factor is the high number of cars. Today, companies manufacture a large number of cars and it is pretty easy for people to have one. Furthermore, many families own two or three cars which result in the increase of traffic congestion. Another contributing factor is the lack of public transports. For example, there are very few subway systems in my hometown, Tehran, and bus system is inconvenient and inefficient. Therefore, people use their own cars even in rush hours. The last cause is road system. Most of the streets in my city are narrow and few cars can pass through them simultaneously.\n\nThe problem of traffic has several effects on people and city. The most significant effect is increased anger and frustration. Every day, people experience a delay in reaching their workplaces or universities. This leads to high tension and stress among them. Another feasible effect worth mentioning here is the environmental effect. The quality of air declines because of the exhaust fumes generated by cars which may result in severe health problems such as asthma, bronchitis and heart attacks. The waste of time on average is huge and this is another major drawback the bad traffic is causing.\n\nOverall, traffic is mainly caused by overpopulation and people\u2019s reliance on their own cars.

Personally, I believe that it is better for all concerned if young adults can continue living with their parents and families for a long time, particularly, till they finish their education or get married.\n\nFirst of all, after becoming an adult, it is best for everyone to head out to embrace our independence. Although it is the most important part to consider finance, because when young adults leave their parents, they face unexpected problems and they have to earn money for the cost of living. For instance, for foods, rent, utilities, and health and other insurance etc. Furthermore, if they are studying they should work hard and study to build their future rather than doing part time jobs that might hamper their education.\n\nIn Advance, not only the finances but also they should consider the study potential. Whoever prefer to live with their parents and they believe without any pressure they can spend their youth with more freedom than the others. Because they do not worry about rent, food, work etc. Only they need to focus on their studies. Therefore, they get enough sleep as a benefit. In a competitive society, this is the hardest age to pass, for the reason that some young adults have only seen some external views of independent life. From my experiences in university life one of my friends lived in a share accommodation and had fun and party time in her whole university life, but at the end of the year she had to struggle with her studies and had to stay a long time in university to complete her studies. Until they get bad experiences from life some of them remain blind to see the real world.\n\nIn conclusion, when I consider both arguments it is clear that if young adults live with their families they can get more benefits than the young who live a free life without families.

However, there are some areas that societies still restrict the equality between men and women. I will discuss further this issue through the essay.\n\nI believe that women are still seen as the weak person in the classical stereotype in traditional people, particularly in some remotes area. The traditional way of thinking still believes that women should stay at home and do some house works such as washing clothes, cooking some food, cleaning the house as well as growing the children. This condition tends to restrict the freedom of women to enter the higher education as well as participate more in political area or economical area. The case of Indonesia women migrant labour, moreover, who get violence from the boss also proves that gender equality has not been accommodated yet. People tend to suppose that women are weak and men are the superiority who have more power that women which lead to the case of violence done by men to women.\n\nSome people believe that the idea of gender equality has been approved through the policy of 30% quota in the political position, however, this kind of policy is unfair considering the number of women right now three times bigger than that of men.

Before the invention of television, children often listened to educational programmes on the radio. But unlike radio which is only audio, television is both audio and image. Children today not only listen to but can also watch programmes on television, such as a kindergarten teacher teaching the alphabet. The extra dimension of the image makes learning the alphabet simpler, and it is also easier to remember. Furthermore, in the past, young children often played with toys.

Therefore, the best solution to encounter this problem is by providing fitness centre in the work office that is accessible for every employee to do sports activities during the break time.

It is hard for them to prepare their own meal while the deadline of work is waiting, thus an instant food remains as their choice. Even though they already know that fast food can deteriorate their health, but they keep on consuming as their meals.

In this essay, I will find out its reasons and try to draw some solutions to minimise its negative impacts on human's life.\n\nTo begin with, the main reason for people's unhealthy lifestyle is too much workload in the office. This means they have to work for extra hours in the office and so they cannot spare enough time to make food for themselves at home; eventually, inadvertently they opt for fast food or other readymade package food for them because they are ready to make and tasty despite unhealthy. Another compelling reason is technological advancement which affects greatly to human's life. For example, a few years ago people tend to walk some distance to reach their office when they commute to their workplace and now almost everyone has a car and they do not have to walk. Additionally, home appliances such as advanced dishwasher, microwave oven, and so on have made physical work for a man unlike some years ago. Hence, their passive form of exercises has been increasingly reduced.\n\nThere are few solutions to mitigate the situation. Firstly, individuals should be made known via health awareness programs by the government about benefits of healthy diet and the detrimental effect of junk food and ready-made package food. Moreover, the authority ought to emphasise on building more gyms at a nominal fee in each city so that more people take benefit of them. Secondly, the government should mandate physical education starting from the primary education and they should be graded with their examination with sports performance along with their academic so that pupils encouraged about their health from their childhood. Finally, the government should enforce stringent employment laws that help people to reduce their overtime work and make their work life balance.\n\nIn Conclusion, people living unhealthy lifestyle owing to extra workload given by their employers and advances in technology.

For example, the Auckland Zoo has many breeding programs in place to enable animals to mate and reproduce. These animals might not be able to find mating partners in the wild and hence their species could be wiped out.

A group of people believe that these digital games are beneficial for mankind, but others think that they would be a distraction to human's mind. Although video games have some positive sides, I personally believe that they have more negative effects on our minds, and the following essay will discuss them in details.For a number of reasons, a lot of people believe that video games are entertaining and educative. It is believed that video games could help people in releasing their stress. Players could feel the excitement of being a heroic character or a professional athlete, without having the risk of being injured or hurt. And then, there are some video games which are considered as educative as well, as they are created to trigger people's imaginative thinking, such as Tetris or chess.", "original_link": "https://www.ielts-mentor.com/writing-sample/writing-task-2/1964-some-people-regard-video-games-as-harmless-fun"}, {"essay_topic": "Students should pay the full cost of their own university studies, rather than have free higher education provided by the state.", "extra_topic": "", "model_answer": "\nFree tertiary education has always sparks heated debates all over the world. I, personally, completely disagree that higher education cost should be born by students because that would prevent the waste of talent resource and also it is a form investment for the government in the long run.\n\nWhen higher education comes with a cost, it creates an inefficient allocation of the human resource. This is because when there is a financial constraint, some students from the less privileged background are forced to choose the courses that either is not too costly or have good employability prospects and not necessarily courses that the students want most or are best at. As a result, for example, instead of being an excellent artist, the student can only be a mediocre accountant because he cannot utilise all his potential in his chosen field, causing a waste of talent; free higher education can prevent this problem.\n\nThe second reason why tertiary education should be free is because if the government chooses not to spend money on free education, they will see rising expenditures in other areas. For example, a less educated workforce bears a higher risk of unemployment in the economic downturn, and thus the government\u2019s coffers for unemployment aid would need to increase. Furthermore, unskilled labour earns much less than college-educated people do, and thus they contribute less income tax i.e. less revenue for the government. Not to mention, the highly skilled population is essential to any country\u2019s economic growth in the long run.\n\nIn conclusion, because free education allows students to learn what they enjoy most and are best at, it can ensure better allocation of the human resource. Furthermore, free education can reduce unemployment cost in the economic downturn, increase government\u2019s tax revenue, and increase economic growth in the long run.

Scientific researches have proved that some of the animals have a similar body structure that we have. So it is advisable and feasible to do experiments on animals first and perform some basic analysis and then start experiments on humans. This approach will cause less damage and cost for the research. Apart from this, it is really hard to find the human body for scientific experiments. So scientists do not have any other option because there are very few persons present in this world who are ready to make themselves available for these experiments. One of the best examples of this is the earlier space programs carried by NASA.

One advantage is that owners can save more money. Clearly, considering a specific room for two or more employees, expenditures can become higher than working from home because rental and utility bills can be decreased far considerably. For example, a computer software engineer can finish and send his project through the web at the end of the month; therefore, he can do his tasks from home, and lesser funds will be spent for him totally.\n\nAnother benefit is that people can save their time. Obviously, travelling several hours a day, many employees have to spend their valuable time on traffic jams, while it is not necessary they commute between their home and workplace as they work from home. As a prime example, my brother, who is an electronic engineer, had to spend almost two hours daily between his home and workplace; however, as his employers accepted he to do his duty from home, he has saved more than ten hours a week, and his performance has improved fundamentally. As a result, not only this method can be more economical, but less time-consuming.\n\nBesides, I believe that telecommuting will become a more common system in the future. One reason behind it is that individuals will have a better access to a faster Internet. Undoubtedly, the Internet is an essential factor that assists employees to achieve their duties, so as the speed of Internet develops, huge works will be accomplished far easily from home, leading home jobs to become a commoner type of working. Furthermore, increasing traffic load, especially in sprawling cities, will encourage employers to give green light to this type of working.\n\nIn conclusion, home jobs have had many important advantages to businesses and workers, not only in the matter of their expenses but time.

Firstly, many countries have positive economic growth these days, which means that most of their residents' income has increased. As their income increase, it means that they could pay the respective penalties, and it would not solve the density problem.

Despite the various benefits the cities can provide, the life quality suffers under a diverse set of environmental and socio-economic issues. In this essay, the most prevalent reasons and solutions will be discussed.\n\nOne of the most critical causes of the shattering quality is the worsening of the city dwellers' health due to various environmental pollutants. The smog in the World capitals and other high-density urban areas- e.g. Shanghai and Los Angeles- has become unbearable for their inhabitants and require the undertaking of hampering measures.\n\nThe other often mentioned cause is intensified crime events. For that reason people are living under constant fear and threat; leaving them prone to stress related diseases and higher probabilities of falling victims of crimes. For instance, in Latin America's biggest cities, like Sao Paolo, is not recommended for women to walk alone at the streets even during the daylight.\n\nFor the problems, there are always solutions. Referring back to the pollution problem, the cure has been declared mainly by the means of cleaner energy and transportation systems. Many so-called 'green cities' like Copenhagen are leading the way in the development of higher quality public transports and prioritising the light vehicle traffic.\n\nDealing with crimes is a far more complicated. Psychologists believe that more beautiful, clean and happy external environment can reduce crime levels. Thus, this can be something city planners should look into more deeply when planning our urban areas. But most likely, providing people sufficient amount of opportunities and guidance in their lives would be the most effective prevention measure as far as I believe.\n\nTo summarise, there are many adversities that can reduce the urban life quality such as environmental pollution and crime; however, there are also opportunities and tools to reduce these effects.

For instance, for arranging one cricket match panning, a stadium, schedule and other preparation are required. People also purchase costly tickets for watching the match. People who travel around the world for watching those matches require accommodation arrangement. This may cause unwanted expenses for countries who can host sporting events.\n\nHowever, we cannot deny the importance of sports in our life. Any international sporting event like Olympic Games gives an opportunity to all participants to perform their best and make records. Sports lovers around the world definitely would get the best entertainment because of such events. Nowadays films, television serials are entertaining and popular among people.

Definitely, availability of more human resources, medications or transportation can assist the state authority to be able to save more injured people's lives. For example, during tsunami occurred in the South Asia in 2003, the local governments burdened the duty of saving many citizens from death, far greater than any private organisation.

Clearly, only governments have a direct access to this financial resource, and this money should be considered for helping of dwellers hurt by calamities.

While free medical service is hard to maintain for a government with budget scarcity, it is a must to ensure a healthy nation. Some disadvantages are there but they can be controlled with strict laws and monitoring.\n\nTo begin with, medical services and treatments are quite expensive and the majority of the people, even in a rich nation, can not afford it. This is why the government has to intervene and make the health care affordable for all and provide free services for poor citizens. It is natural that a great number of people avoid meeting doctors for minor diseases due to expensive medical services.

I agree with the statement and the reasons behind the agreement are as followed.\n\nEarlier, before 2000, women were subject to be dominated everywhere. They had the typical roles to care for the home. But after the millennium, a sudden change took place everywhere. The majority of the women became aware of their rights, responsibilities and changed their roles.

They are occupying the positions of men and dominating the world. As a result, now males are turning subject to sexual discrimination as the women experienced in yester decades. The hanged scenarios led males to be less prioritised in different sectors, especially the most important sector - employment.

This essay delves with the viewpoint before it closes the argument.\n\nFirstly, international sporting events help to build some special relations between the hostile countries. For instance, the relationship between India and Pakistan is not so friendly and they have disputes on many issues. But the disputes are overlooked on the playground. When the teams participate in cricket, the relationships among the players are not hostile. They are cooperative and exercise the best friendly attitude with each other. If it continues, it is expected that the cold relations between the two countries will turn warmer someday. Moreover, such events bring foreign revenue, inspire sports lover to take part in outdoor games and promote a healthy lifestyle.\n \nBut on the contrary, the disadvantages are also acknowledgeable. When an international and exciting sports competition is arranged, people want to watch those events \u2013 some prefer to watch live in the playground while many like to watch on television sitting at home. To enjoy a high voltage cricket match or exciting Olympic events, people need to waste their valuable times both day and night. A hardcore cricket fan may bunk office, school or may make late-rising early next morning for sleeping late at night. Thereby, in a greater consideration, this is a waste of time, effort and money for the ordinary people. On top of that, hosting those events requires a huge sum of money and efforts.\n\nTo finish the argument, I would like to say that, though arranging big events is costly, they have many advantages. They promote friendly relationship, entertain people, promote tourism and inspire young people to participate more in sports. This is why I disagree with the view that big sporting events are an enormous waste of fund, time and effort.

As a result, we are turning into machines than human and that is resulting in a limited relationship even with the next door neighbours. Now, the relationship among neighbours is dismal than the past. This essay delves into the reasons for this distant relationship among neighbours and some ways to improve it.\n\nFirst of all, people, these days, lack their leisure hours. They are unable to arrange times for socialising. In fact, they are to follow the strict routines, execute respective occupational duties, and if someone fails, survival turns challenging for them. So, people cannot manage extra hours to spent with neighbours. As a result relationship among people declines.\n \nOn contrary, often people do lack the sense of consideration. They seem to have less care for others. For instance, I have a neighbour in my next flat who is a singer and work at a local band. So, when he starts practising in the middle of the night, it is really irritating for me. I have notified the issue several times to him but that was of no use. So, I decided not to socialise with him anymore as his irrational behave developed an unpleasant feeling inside me about him. The similar scenarios are found randomly that is resulting in relationship decline.\n\nActually, there are no specific ways to improve the relationship with neighbours. I believe the application of common sense is enough towards a healthy relationship with neighbours. The most important matter about this \u2013 each of the people should be aware of their rights and responsibilities, and limitations. For instance, I am not responsible for caring for my neighbour\u2019s dog on my lawn or home. Similarly, the neighbours should also be aware of such issues so that any of their attitudes or activities cause trouble for others. when everyone will be aware of the issue, I think the relationship will come to a pleasant level.

I agree that modern world has a completely different set of criteria for assessing or honouring a member of the society, though they are not the real elements to define a person.  \n \nEarlier, societies had some specific indicators to judge a man or woman. Among the judging indicators, they preferred qualities like honesty, kindness, trusts, honour etc. But with the change of time, such pointers have vanished. Unluckily the present society prefers social status or riches to judge anyone. A real-life experience may make it simpler. Recently, I closely observed a local election in a distant part of India. Among the two candidates \u2013 one of them came from a high profile background while the other one was a shabby man who merely had his own permanent living space in the locality. The majority of the people supported the first individual. They took him granted as a gentleman as he is enriched with material possessions. On the contrary, only a few people supported the poor guy. He was unable to spend bucks for the election but was competing on some moral grounds. He dreamt of changing the society. Unluckily he was defeated by the wealthy candidate. The rich man did not allow his opposition to be an obstacle to his success.\n\nThis triumph and defeat made me realise that material possessions are the key to judging as important in society. When people have enough riches to spend, they can buy social status and supports. But unfortunately, when someone comes up with humanitarian features, social elites term them as old-fashioned. They are ignored.\n\nTherefore, I think such ideas should be changed. We should appreciate the humane features than social status and material possessions. Otherwise, the consequences will be detrimental. When the social status will be the indicator to judge oneself, I believe that would be too humiliating and may lead to massive social disorder.

But this trend should be changed. I support that the government should inspire employers to pick youths in needs of new workers for the following reasons.\n\nFirst of all, a large number of educated youths are unemployed in different parts of the world. For instance, in my land, Pakistan, the number of educated youths is not few. A substantial number of highly educated youths are seeking jobs but not getting as the employers prefer the expert hands. They do not rely upon the unskilled fresh graduates. If this trend continues, the rate of unemployment will go beyond control shortly.  \n\nMoreover, unless the young people are getting involved with any sort of jobs or professions, they will not get their experience. So, at least to make them experienced in a particular field, the employers should pick them. Salary is not a fact for the fresh graduates, they are in need of a job to prove their skills and get some ideas on professional life. There were no jobs for a fresher like me in Pakistan a couple of years ago. When I completed my graduation from the University of Karachi, it was really difficult for me to find a job. Almost all the job advertisements required applicants having at least three years of professional experiences. If the authority fails to motivate companies to hire fresh graduates, many of them would become depressed and get involved in crimes.\n\nTo conclude the topic, I think it is only the government who can intervene here to change the situation. Still, a large number of educated youths are seeking jobs. The scenario is almost the same around the world.

Basically, the government wants to underscore on state language other than anything. Such policies have some advantages and demerits too. A comparative discussion is done in the following paragraphs.\n\nFirst of all, the government puts emphasis on the mother tongue of the state so that the kids could learn the state language effectively and communicate. As a result, the kids turn expert on national language. Further, as they are expert, communication is easier for them inside the national boundary. Actually, when kids are in schools and they are to learn several languages, it becomes difficult for them to cope with the words, dialects and other linguistic issues. Thereby, importance on certain language in school is reasonable. For instance, in most of the Asian countries, it is compulsory to study the mother tongue in elementary schools.\n\nOn the other hand, teaching a certain language may create a sense of excessive dependency on that specific language. As a result, it may hamper their communication skills in a different perspective. They will lose confidence to communicate in the international environment.\nMy 5-year old daughter, Samantha, is in her elementary school here in France. The school strictly forbids using English or any other language than French during the school hours. The intentions are respectable and kids are learning French perfectly. But at the same time, kids are losing their ability to communicate in English or in other international languages. Learning it in a later phase of life is less effective than learning at an early age, I think.\n\nFinally, after the aforesaid arguments, I believe adoption of such policies is ineffective. The ratio of demerits is almost equal to its benefits. So, if we justify the needs, the outcomes will be under satisfactory level.

So, when they are engaged in to learn something newer, they turn wondering and consequently come to know about everything. The fact is similar to children in primary schools. When they will learn a new language in class, the language will offer an insight to them which makes them curious to know more about the people of other cultures or using that language. It creates a scope to explore the world which finally helps them to widen their knowledge.  \n\nSecondly, learning at a mature age is difficult. Usually, adults experience numerous obstacles while learning like they lack time, subjects appear difficult etc. So, learning turns ineffective and if it is a foreign language, the troubles rise more. My son, a primary grade student, was curious about Spanish. He had a course titled \u2018How to learn Spanish\u2019 in his school. So, he wanted to know more about people and culture of Spain and often tried to speak Spanish.

Hunting not only makes few species extinct but also affects the dairy industry of the country.\n    \nFirstly, there are a few species which are already very limited in numbers. Thus, hunting such animals will make them extinct. Take tigers, for example. A survey conducted by the forest department of India shows that currently there are only 2000 odd tigers left in India, compared to 3500 odd in 2014. This exponentially decreasing count of tigers clearly shows that if hunting is not stopped, our next generation might just be left with only images of tigers.\n    \nMoreover, the Indian economy is highly dependent on the dairy industry. Thus, any impact on this industry will directly affect the economy of the country. Indubitably, the act of hunting is doing no good for the dairy industry. For example, if the count of the milk producing cattle is decreased, automatically the production of dairy products would also be reduced.

Additionally, it is possible to send an email to any person on the planet and that letter the receiver will get in a second after it has been sent. Therefore, the Net allows making the communication faster. By connecting to the Web from any place, a person can access any information available there.

The amount of air pollution it causes is quite alarming. A single flight emits a huge amount of carbon dioxide to the air contributing to the greenhouse effect. Furthermore, airports in cities hamper the peace of local people and increase the possibility of terrorist attacks.\n\nMany experts suggest that one way to check the negative consequences of increasing air travel is to impose more tax.

In this way, it can be argued that teaching the role of parents in schools would not be pragmatically fruitful unless it is intuitively assimilated from their parents and family members.\n\nIn regard to the competence of a mother or a father, there are several things to be considered; first and foremost is the abundance of love and care, secondly strict rules to discipline their life, thirdly responsibility, fourthly doing things that the children would find inspirational and lastly to be able to educate them. What\u2019s more is expertness in handling finance so that the children can have a better healthcare, food, education and relaxed life.\n\nTo conclude, the academic subjects should be concentrated and taught in schools, as it had been until now since it is the most integral part education. This is not only because of the mindset of juveniles but also to extirpate such classes and let them learn from their own parents during the course of life.[ Written by - Nivetha ]", "original_link": "https://www.ielts-mentor.com/writing-sample/writing-task-2/1890-ielts-writing-task-2-sample-801-schools-to-teach-every-young-person-how-to-be-a-good-parent"}, {"essay_topic": "In many countries these days, the number of people continuing their education after school has increased, and the range of courses available at universities and colleges has also increased.", "extra_topic": "", "model_answer": "\nThroughout the 21st century, a lot of universities have been built across the globe. It has become extremely easy for the students to get admission in universities to pursue higher studies in the area of their interest. I agree that when more students attain degree means that it will bring a positive impact on the society.\n\nFirstly, students have the flexibility to choose a course when universities provide multiple courses, especially new ones, based on the course subject, fees or duration. For example, a financially backwards person can opt for a low budget course and still become a graduate. Thus, universities can empower the society.\n\nSecondly, finding a breakthrough in a career is easy when a person has some specialised skills. Moreover, there are many industries facing resource shortage. For instance, as per the report published by the Week magazine dated 2th September 215, illustrates that hundred percent of the students in the hotel management course are being a job offer in their final year, by the industries requiring them. Therefore, the special skills universities benefit both students and industries.\n\nFinally, a sense of public awareness is created among the citizens, which results in the decrease of crime rate as well as improvement in the behaviour of the people, due to the knowledge gained in their courses. For example, this decade crime rate has drastically reduced by 10 percent compared to the previous one. Therefore, by having more education, the earth can become a better and safe place to live.\n\nIn conclusion, education can bring in a myriad of benefits to the society. It is the duty of the respective governments to ensure that their citizens are well educated and support the needy. The more choices on universities and area of studies in those universities undoubtedly have many positive impacts.[ Written by - Zuhr ]", "original_link": "https://www.ielts-mentor.com/writing-sample/writing-task-2/1889-ielts-writing-task-2-sample-800-people-continuing-their-education-after-school-has-increased"}, {"essay_topic": "In many countries insufficient respect is shown to older people. What do you think may be the reason for this? What problems might this cause in society?", "extra_topic": "", "model_answer": "\nRespect shown to senior citizens is often considered by many as an important indicator of a civilised society and yet this is on the decline in many countries. In my opinion, lack of proper teaching at home and a paradigm shift towards a materialistic life are the reason for this trend. This trend can bring some negative consequences in our society which would be outlined in this essay.   \n\nIn regard to the declining respects for elderly people, the family bonding and parents teaching methods at home are to be blamed. The family value and bond are no longer important to the young generation these days. They are not entirely responsible for this social debasement as parents nowadays are too busy to teach their children morality. On top of that, young generation in this era is more occupied with materialistic possessions than reading history and learning about their traditions and cultures. As a result, they fail to understand how important it is to show respect to other members of the society, especially senior citizens. To illustrate an example, one of my classmates, Tony, was raised in a nuclear family and without his father. When he visited our house, he had no idea that my grandparents could live in our family. Certainly, he would not know how to spend time with people over 60 years old!\n\nAmong the negative consequences of this trend, the most severe one is the moral degradation of youth. Since they find it unnecessary to show proper respect to elder people, they will soon forget to respect other human beings. Moreover, they will fail to teach their next generation anything about mutual respect and family value, they will suffer even more when they become old. Finally, as a whole, the society would have selfish members who would not be able to maintain a social harmony.\n\nTo conclude, the society we live in is the contribution os the senior citizens and that is why the young generation should show their respect and gratitude to them. The lack of respect towards the elderly is a great concern and to mitigate this problem, parents should teach their children morality and importance or family bonds.

As a result, stress-related illnesses are on the increase around the world.\n\nWhy is stress such a problem in the modern world and what do you think can be done to overcome the problems caused by stress?", "extra_topic": "", "model_answer": "\nNowadays stress has become a serious problem than it was in the past. Over the world, many different diseases are caused by stress. In today\u2019s world, some people ask themselves why stress is such a big issue as well as how to reduce it. This essay will discuss the causes to stress related illnesses and solutions to deal with this problem.\n\nIn the highly competitive environment stress is an illness that experienced approximately everyone because of modern tension and pressure whereas before individuals had fewer issues to think about. For example, our generation works longer hours and bear a heavy workload in comparison with the past generations. The business competition will be more serious in the future and as a result, more and more people will suffer from stress-related issues. The increasing competition and challenges in every field of life, lack of family and social bonding, increasing expenses, political instability, international tension, environmental pollution, longer working hours, high expectation and dependency of technology everywhere are some of the main reasons the stress related problems are so high these days.\n\nIn comparison with the past when people did not have to think about the existence of stress, nowadays it has become a global problem. People had the same diseases in the past but they did not know for sure what the causes were. Recently the cause was found \u2013 the stress which is a serious threat to the wellbeing of human and leads to many negative symptoms that exhaust a person\u2019s body and mind. With the less population, the competition was lesser and the environment was better in the past. That\u2019s why they had comparatively less stress in their lives.   \n\nThe key to a stress-free life is being contended with whatever we have. If we can be happy with whatever we have got and aspire for a bright future, we will definitely have less stress related issues. Everyone must maintain a balanced work and social life in order to lessen the amount of stress related problems they suffer. Getting engaged in physical activities and hobbies can be another solution to address this. The employers should reduce the working hours and arrange other facilities to reduce the amount of pressure the employees feel in the workplace. Our social and family bonding can also help us to fight this problem to a great extent. \n\nThere is no doubt that over the last few years stress has become one of the major reasons for serious illnesses such as heart diseases, asthma, obesity, diabetes and headaches. For this reason, ideas like relaxation centres, aromatherapies and massage centres have emerged and they can help people to reduce their mental pressure. Doing exercises, communicating with friends and families or organising a hobby will make them happier and busier in the daily routine.  \n\nTo sum up, life has become more stressful for our generation than the past generations and thoughtful measures could be taken to address this issue including strong relationship, engagement in activities, and working smarter than working harder and for long hours.[ Written by - Natalia Svetlova ]", "original_link": "https://www.ielts-mentor.com/writing-sample/writing-task-2/1887-ielts-writing-task-2-sample-798-why-is-stress-such-a-problem-in-the-modern-world"}, {"essay_topic": "Even though doctors all over the world agree that fast food is bad for people's health more and more people are eating it.

While some people are convinced that adverts targeting the young residents to shape their preferences of food have higher influence than family and friends. I, however, disagree with this notion.\n\nTo begin with, we are living in a world where adverts are all around us and their influence on young generation is more severe than adults. Advertisements, especially those targets teenagers and related to food and beverage, spend a huge amount of money to allure them to a better living standard which are, most of the cases, lies. Consequently, young people are trapped and prefer fast food than home-made menus. For instance, a recent survey conducted on college students in my city revealed that they prefer pizza, subway sandwich and burger than the foods their mums prepare at home. Further studies explained that those students have little conscious of the balanced diet and are exposed to TV and online advertisements.                  \n\nHaving said that, family and friends have a greater influence on a teenager's eating habit. A family has a greater role in shaping a child's food intake habit and scientific studies prove that our diet habit is deeply rooted in the type of food we eat in our childhood. Thus, if a teenager has a bad eating habit, the family is to blame for that. On top of that, when a child starts making friends, he is significantly get influenced by his friends eating and drinking habit. To illustrate, based on a recent research published in the magazine 'Healthy Living', more than 70% school going teenagers try to mimic the diet habit of their friends who they spend time with. This statistics clearly reveal that our family members and friends have more influence on our choices of foods and drinks than the advertisements we are exposed to.\n\nTo conclude, food habit is a significant part of our life as it defines who we become and how healthy, both physically and psychologically, we would be in the future. Advertisements, to a certain extent, have an impact on young people's diet, but family and friends have an even greater role.

I believe that we should focus both on our career and hobbies to maintain a balance in our life and to lead a happy and meaningful life.\n\nIn regards to work or career, I think that it defines who we are and how we contribute to the society we live in. Perfectly executing our job responsibilities would ensure a steady career growth and a contentment in our life. It is quite reasonable that when we find our works interesting, we can excel in our performance as we work passionately. Undeniably, devotion on our jobs would bring out the best in us and let us reinvent our hidden potentials. To cite an example, many scientists, throughout the history, have completely devoted themselves to their work and have brought marvellous invention for the rest of the humanity. Thus to a certain group of people, work is far more important than any other thing in life.\n\nIn contrast, another group of people find their hobbies and leisure activities more interesting and focus more on these activities than their career and work. I believe, to a certain extent, they are prudent to emphasise more on things they feel attracted to as we have got only one life to live and being happy and contented is the mantra of life. However, their priority in life often lead to negligence in professional life and as a consequence, they suffer from economic disaster in later life.\n\nTo conclude, we are the ultimate architect of our life and how we lead our life would define our future.

", "extra_topic": "", "model_answer": "\nThe written exam was the only possible evaluation method in the past and thanks to the technological advancements for numerous other techniques to assess a student's academic performance nowadays. It is quite obvious that schools and other educational and training institutions are opting for a combination of different assessment methods and this shift has both advantages and demerits, which I shall examine in this essay.\n\nTo start with the advantages, practical approaches to evaluating students not only consider the overall learning and understanding of a student but also the accuracy and depth of their knowledge. For instance, in a paper based exam, a student can easily memorise the answers and perform well in written test; but when he is asked to demonstrate the knowledge his knowledge in a lab, his memorise-and-answer ability would help him a little. In practical exams, students who have really learned the lessons would pass with flying colours. Furthermore, assessment methods like interviews, group assignments, presentations and lab experiments prepare pupil to face the challenges in professional life.  \n\nTurning to the disadvantages of practical assessment, many students can cheat the evaluation process and pass the exam with a little devotion to study. For instance, a recent survey conducted on students in five different colleges revealed that students prefer group assignments, online presentations and lab experiments than written exam as they need to study more for the later one. On top of that, sometimes, teachers favour particular students and mark some students poorly due to personal reasons and the authority has little to do to reassess this marking scheme at a later date.\n\nTo conclude, genuine assessment of a student is quite an essential task for the schools and a combination of evaluation process should be implemented. Practical assessment offers many benefits and subsequently prepare students for the future challenges in both academic and professional environment.

However, overall, this has far more advantages than demerits and if not overused, technologies like the high-speed internet and smart TV can be  great learning tools for the people, especially young.\n\nTo begin with, powerful internet connection, smart TV, gaming console etc. all have entertaining as well as educational values. If not misused, young generation can learn from these sophisticated and advanced devices. The merits or demerits of these devices lie on the parental guidance and the way they are utilised. For instance, if a child watches TV programmes all day long, it would negatively affect his eyes, health and academic performance. However, if a teenager watches educational videos and programmes on YouTube and channels like the NetGeo or  Discovery, he would definitely learn many new things.\n\nAnother key point to remember, people need entertainment in order to lead a stress-free and happy life. The lack of entertainment facility often attributes towards the moral degradation and this is quite alarming. Hence, people must have ways to spend some quality times on their own. Modern tools like computers, tabloid PCs and smart TVs fill the gap and allow busy people find ways to enjoy their leisure time. Considering this, I would like to suggest that latest technology for the personal and family entertainment is rather a blessing.\n\nTo conclude, the home entertainment technology itself does not have the ability to bring detrimental outcomes for people.

By doing so, we are compromising safety issues and depriving people to take benefits from the modern and advanced technology.\n\nThere is no doubt that modern products are designed in accordance with latest technology and safety measures.

In particular, in the Northshore areas of Vancouver city of Canada, individuals cannot easily travel by Skytrain because there is no any train station there.

Others feel we should encourage more young people to take up a trade such as plumbing, painting or building to ensure a good balance of skills in our society.", "extra_topic": "", "model_answer": "\nWhile some opine that university education is a must, others, however, emphasise the need for vocational training and practical skills more. No doubt skills on practical works like plumbing, painting, repairing, automobiles etc. are essential for the young generation to start a career early, but university education offers something more and creates a better future generation. This essay will discuss both aspects and point out my opinion.\n\nTo begin with, university education has a paramount importance in shaping someone's ability, perspective and knowledge. That is why a person is thought to be prepared to start a career or open a business only when he completes his tertiary education. Many organisations, for instance, seek employees who have university degrees and research indicates that university graduates are more adept at learning new things in the corporate world, taking challenges, leading a team and bringing innovations. Thus taking up trade education or courses instead of getting admitted to a college or university would build up a generation who would be skilled in some particular fields, no doubt, but not ready to lead the country by contributing in a more efficient manner in their respective job or business fields. In many countries, such as India, a plumber, electrician or a painter have no scope to enhance their career in prestigious corporations or ever become a white collar employee. Furthermore, the society does not consider them as skilled employees since they do not have the necessary education to excel. Thus taking up university education in those countries is the only option to gather knowledge and secure a good career.\n\nWith regards to the trade courses to have a skilled workforce in a country, I believe that only a few developed countries should encourage their young population to start their career in such fields where they can have decent jobs. For instance, Finland already has this educational setup and they are quite successful. Furthermore, skilled people will never be unemployed and thus would contribute to the national economy at an early age.\n\nTo conclude, though having trade related courses and vocational education to start a career early and to maintain a social skill balance us a good option, I believe that university education is far more beneficial. It should be ensured by the government that deserving students get university education though there is no harm in including some trade-related training courses in university to make them more skilled.

In this essay, I shall discuss both aspects and include my verdict.\n\nTo begin with, education sectors and schools in many countries have embraced the computer and the internet technology and the way of teaching and learning is no longer the same as it was in the past. For example, one of my nephews, George, who is 4 years old, have learned the alphabets, colours, digits and many rhymes from the internet which was unimaginable even in our era. University students prepare their assignments and thesis on a computer, a plagiarism checking software initially reviews it, the teacher assesses the answers on a computer and this process goes on with the help of technology. Professionals like journalists, writers, bloggers, programmers, bankers and so on, no longer need to write manually as computers are there for them. With more corporations going digital, the need for handwriting is shrinking rapidly. Furthermore, may of the standardised exams have their computerised version and this eliminates the needs for an excellent handwriting skill and demands the skill of typing on swipe a digital device like the computer.\n\nAccording to the second group of people, handwriting is still essential and no matter how much dependant we become on technology, it will always be a handy ability for a person. For instance, a computer literate would still be considered ignorant if he can not write something on a paper. This group of people also opine that handwriting ability enables someone to excel in his academic studies and exams. Though some exams have become digitalised most others require us to write on a paper using a pen or pencil. Thus to present our skills we still need the handwriting skills. Last but not least, use of the technology requires electric power, devices like computers and the internet connections which are yet to be available in many parts of the world.

A combination of other initiatives is also required. First, we need to aware people about the devastating consequences traffic rule violations can bring to our life.

That is why I totally agree with the idea that children should focus more on mathematics and a foreign language in academic life than arts subjects unless he wants to become an artist or a musician in professional life.\n\nOn one hand, music and arts are important for our personal and social life. However, it can be learned by anybody but everybody cannot become an artist or musician without inherent talent and total dedication beyond academic study. Moreover job market for arts and music is much smaller when compared with technological and science related occupations. For instance, if a media company requires an artist, they will hire very few artists and their communication and language skills would also be judged. At the same time, lower pay rates in art related subjects should also be considered while deciding which major a child should take in his academic life.\n\nOn the other hand, mathematics is an essential subject that everyone should learn. This subject encourages children to think and improve the brain capacity and memory. Moreover, mathematics is involved and an important part of every job sector these days, including information technology, auto engineering, banking, designing, researching, construction engineering and so on.  At the same time, skill in an extra language always increases the opportunity for a job seeker.

I firmly believe that both education and food aid are helpful in solving this problem.\n\nThere is no doubt that education can help poor people become wealthier and be able to provide themselves, for example, buy groceries and pay bills. This happens because after school graduation teenagers are able to find only low payable jobs and most of them cannot cover their bills or buy enough food to survive. For this reason, many people go to University to study. Moreover, in the highly competitive business environment after completing degree most of the graduates can find better jobs with higher income rather than they were able to do after school. Also, there is no end of tertiary education as people can do a masters degree and the salary of those will increase gradually. All these examples are the sufficient evidence that education is a major source of obtaining wealthy lifestyle. To develop and progress as a nation, the citizens must be educated. The globalisation has made it possible to live and work in any country but to do so someone has to be educated and skilled. The migrated people also send a huge sum of revenue that helps the country to develop. Hence to alleviate the poverty and hunger, education is the key. In terms of fighting the hunger and poverty globally, education helps to make the people be skilled and more efficient. For instance, an educated farmer has far more potential to contribute to producing more crops than an uneducated farmer. The Same rule applies in all other sectors as well.\n\nThe next point that needs to be taken into consideration is that food aid obviously helps to tackle starvation over the world because it is the first necessary thing to do when people are hungry. For example, there are places in Africa where individuals are dying from hunger because there is no food and job prospect there.  For this reason, food aid is vital in helping those and after that ensuring education and training could be helpful. Education is not achieved overnight and to educate a generation in a country needs a huge budget. On the contrary, people are dying from hunger and scarcity of food.

In particular, as users are searching on Google, they unconsciously see different advertisements shown by different companies on the each side of the page. Therefore, they are tempted to watch the related page more and purchase shoes, shirts or other clothing. Another factor is that consumers have access to more variation of styles and brands than before. Obviously, competition between different international companies has led them to generate more different brands with specific logos. As a prime example, while only Adidas, Nike, Puma or Reebok were the leading sportswear by the year 1990, more different sports clothing have been allowed to be produced with different names after that time, like Columbia or Asics.

One is that they are more to find better job positions. Clearly, the branches of many multinational companies are located in large cities than in small cities. For example, a fresh computer graduate living in a small village of the USA is rarely able to find an appropriate career in his place, while by moving and living in Los Angeles, he will be able to apply for IBM, HP, Microsoft or other international corporations. Another benefit is that they can have a better lifestyle. Obviously, urban inhabitants can have more options to inhabit, like living in skyscrapers or luxurious huge mansions which might not be found in suburb areas. The advancement of technology and modernisation are fewer in rural areas than those in the city. Finally factories, industries and other companies also attract labours and blue collar job seekers and that\u2019s another reason many people move to large cities.   \n\nThis migration trend has changed the social structure and the economy of cities.

Apart from the positive aspects, this mixed culture offers, many social and environmental problems are also being created because of that.\n\nIn my view, this change of living condition has had more negative consequences than having more probable advantages. One obvious disadvantage is raising the density of air pollutants in cities. Unfortunately, using more private cars in metropolitan, dwellers are faced numerous heart and lung problems. In particular, had the government of Tehran, the capital of Iran, prohibited migration of rural people there, the rate of morbidity and mortality would have dropped fundamentally since last three decades. According to medical officials\u2019 report, just over 40000 of humans in Tehran died because of air pollution in 2014. Furthermore, traffic congestion has been deteriorated in urban areas. Admittedly, as the population grew, more private cars were to be used, leading traffic loads inflated far considerably and causing people to have more stress. However, controlling of immigration of villagers could reduce traffic jams, and citizens had less tension in their daily life.\n\nTo sum up, although displacement of humans into major urban areas has had some credible benefits, its negative influences must not be forgotten. Increasing the density of air emissions and traffic congestion are the two prominent consequences that have jeopardised city dwellers\u2019 lives because of mass immigration.[ Written by - Rambod ]", "original_link": "https://www.ielts-mentor.com/writing-sample/writing-task-2/1855-ielts-writing-task-2-sample-766-the-way-modern-society-is-developing-is-being-shaped-by-people-s-migration"}, {"essay_topic": "Cinema attendance in some countries is on the decline.

This essay examines the various reasons of this trend and tries to propose practical solutions for this menace towards film industry.To begin with, people have no sufficient free time to do their leisure activities as they are busy with their responsibilities: both professional and individual. For example, most of the people in India are doing full- time jobs without a break to meet their increasing economic needs for the family. Therefore, they may not get chances for enjoying cinema with their family or friends. Moreover, quality of the film is another important reason. To explain, some filmmakers do some compromises in different sections such as casting, editing and visual effects, while making new films and create poor quality movies. Such type of movies makes boredom for the audience very easily and as a result, they have no interest to watch these. For all these reasons, cinema attendance is declining a greater extent in some nations. The availability of Smart TV, internet and computer has made it possible to enjoy movies at home and that is another reason people do not want to visit cinema often.\n\nHowever, there are several methods to tackle this issue effectively. Firstly, the government should reduce working load of people and make sure enough entertainment facilities for them in order to improve film attendance rate. In addition to that, the cost of film tickets should be reduced which would be helpful for ordinary people to buy film tickets from film theatres. Furthermore, all films should meet the basic standard to assure the quality. To be clear, standard films would be a visual treat for audiences and would also motivate them to watch again. By doing these methods issue can be solved to a certain extent.", "original_link": "https://www.ielts-mentor.com/writing-sample/writing-task-2/1854-ielts-writing-task-2-sample-765-cinema-attendance-in-some-countries-is-on-the-decline"}, {"essay_topic": "All countries throughout the world are facing health issues related to modern lifestyles.

There are various reasons that have caused the situation and the following essay will discuss them and some of the things that people could do to address the problem.\n\nFor a number of reasons, many people are facing debt problem nowadays due to the consumptive lifestyles. Firstly, with the existence of social media such as Facebook or Instagram, more people are showing off their luxurious goods, take some photos and upload them into the applications and it triggers them to buy fancy stuff.  Secondly, with the significant growth in the number of elite malls, they attract people in spending more money on secondary needs such as fashion, jewellery or gadgets. And lastly, as applying and obtaining credit cards are easier these days, many people are buying expensive things which are greater than their income. As a consequence of this hedonism lifestyle, many people are ended up with a serious problem of debts.\n\n\nThere are several things that people could do to solve the problem. One of them is that there should be a clear regulation about credit cards that must be followed by banks and financial institutions, regarding the procedure of issuing credit cards to their consumers. It must be ensured that the credit limit that is given to credit card holders is aligned with the individual\u2019s income. And then, instead of adding more malls in the city, the government should focus on building more public parks and children playgrounds. Therefore, people would have more options for entertainments besides going to the shopping centres.\n\nIn conclusion, it is true that a lot of people are having debt problems, as they purchase luxurious stuff and having fancy lifestyles. Some of the factors that trigger the problem are due to the effect of social media, the increasing number of shopping malls and the easier procedure in obtaining credit cards. And to solve the issue, the government should make a better regulation about credit card usage and build more public facilities; therefore people have more alternative places to visit beside malls.[ Written by - Darwin Lesmana ]", "original_link": "https://www.ielts-mentor.com/writing-sample/writing-task-2/1852-ielts-writing-task-2-sample-763-some-people-get-into-debt-by-buying-things-they-don-t-need"}, {"essay_topic": "Nowadays technology is increasingly being used to monitor what people are saying and doing (for example, through cell phone tracking and security cameras).

Almost everybody have their own mobile phone nowadays, and they can use it for browsing, chatting and online gaming.  With all the attractive and entertaining applications, many people like to play around with their gadget for hours and abandon their social life. As a result, it has been reported that many families are having communication problems these days due to they have less time for an eye to eye contact with other family members.  \n\nHowever, it can be clearly seen that the problem has risen due to the improper and indiscipline act of users themselves.

We are in the 21st century and we have a solution for almost everything.

The young people are more energetic and of course, it influences to their life perspectives. As bad luck would have it, sometimes the young are being self-righteous despite their wrong manners. Most time their attitudes become obdurate, as a repercussion of it, they squabble with each other over the trivial peccadillos.\n \nOn the other hand, the adults' characters differ from the young utterly. They are much more sophisticated in terms of the life experience. That is why they fathom everything thoroughly. It behoves the young to get advice from the adults in order to comprehend the life in depth. At the same time, the grown-up\u2019s behaviour are more tranquil and congenial in the society and it is undoubtfully true that in the essence of each stupendous achievement belonging to any young person stands the old\u2019s aid and advice.\n\nSometimes as children are getting older, the changes which are encompassed their behaviour tend to the bad way. They feel so that they can do everything and as a result, it contributes to the generating of the feeling of tremendous brash. However, as they become adults, this process inculcates them to garner the new life experiences in the mankind.\n\nTaking all things into account, it seems to me that the changes related  to children\u2019s attitude depend on their trait much more than their age.

This argument will be proven by looking at how the two subjects are important in life and music is only for recreation.\n\nFor one, science and computer are important for our daily lives. For example, when I was studying, science class allowed me to learn the process of the scientific method, problem-solving and critical thinking. These are essential in life and I am using these in every decision I make. Also, in my computer class, I learned how to use the internet that is really a vital tool in doing my research in things I need to know. These make it clear that children should learn science and computer.\n\nIn addition to this, music is just a hobby and it should be optional for children to study. An instance illustrating this action is I. I am not really into music actually, and if I want to learn some sort of this subject, I can just go to the Internet, go to YouTube website where I can watch and study anything. Thus, it is important that the young ones should study computer and the Internet. It is obvious from this that music is not as essential as those of the two mentioned subjects.\n\nIn conclusion, learning science and computer technology are really useful in our day to day life and music is only for recreation and should just be an option in school. It has been proven that children should learn these essential subjects and music should be optional. Thus, it is recommended for the parents to encourage their children to study hard the science and computer subjects.[ Written by - Rona Lyn Olivar ]", "original_link": "https://www.ielts-mentor.com/writing-sample/writing-task-2/1794-ielts-writing-task-2-sample-723-money-and-time-should-be-spent-on-more-useful-subject-like-computer"}, {"essay_topic": "International tourism and international trade are two important aspects of the development of the economy of a country and a country can get numerous benefits from the close relationship it maintains with foreign countries.", "extra_topic": "", "model_answer": "\nToday, the majority of the people travel in different countries as part of their work, travel or living.

I believe that the benefits of this trend have more significance than its demerits and this will continue in the coming years.  \n\nThe widespread usage of a single language, English in this case, attracts foreign investors and tourists from developed countries; promoting globalisation, and it has both advantages and disadvantages. Firstly, the economy is improved through the profitable businesses of multi-national companies. In addition to this, the tourists\u2019 arrivals increase due to hospitality enjoyed when spoken to in a common language. Moreover, this influx increases the government\u2019s revenue generated from the hospitality industry.

Some people make use of holidays in travelling to other places, whereas others want to complete the incomplete works. This essay will discuss how the holidays are utilised by people and advantages of travelling on holidays.\n\nThere are many benefits of travelling to other places on holidays. First and foremost, it gives us pleasure and peace of mind from our routine & busy life. A change is required for any person in his routine life; this gives satisfaction in his life. Secondly, we can meet many people while travelling and can explore many things, which helps to increase our social life. Finally, we are not machines to work all the time and this kind of going away and staying in hotels or camping gives immense pleasure, and this gives us the meaning of our life.\n\nHowever, others prefer to complete things which are incomplete. If every time we make use of holidays in travelling, it is difficult to complete our pending works, as we will be having a little time only for our personal works. For instance, these days, people work 24/7 and getting time for their personal works has become very difficult. If we make ourselves tired in travelling on holidays, it will be very hard to get time and rest, so the better way is to stay at home and take rest by just finishing off our pending works.    \n\nIn my opinion, there are many advantages of going away on holidays. For shorter period holidays, it is better to stay at home, but for longer period holidays, it is better to make use of going away, meeting new people and exploring new things. This will increase our social skills and it gets rid of our fears to travel.

To relax from their busy working life, people take holidays. Some people feel comfortable with just staying at home, whereas, some want to go away from their home and stay in the countryside or in a hotel. I will discuss both points in the below paragraph.\n \nOn one hand, some people like to stay at home instead of going out during holidays. This is because they feel more relaxed at home. For going out they should plan in advance. Also, it requires quite an amount of money for travelling, accommodation, food etc. Also, if there is a small kid in the family it is risky to go out, as kids are more sensitive to climate change and outside food. Also, they feel little insecure from thieves, to leave their home locked. By staying at home, people can spend more time with their family members, which is not normally possible during working days. Furthermore, by staying at home people can do some household works together, to help their partners.\n \nOn the other hand, some feel happier to go out on holidays. Due to the boom in the tourism industry, they can get holiday packages at the best rates. Also, people who travel countryside feel more relaxed due to fresh weather, compared to the polluted city environment. Besides, they can discover new places and children can learn new things about the places. Also, when they stay away from the home and office, they are isolated from routine worries. Furthermore, when family members go out together, it will reduce the friction between the family members if any. Nowadays, we can see many people take treatment for stress by going to the country sides like Madikeri, Coorg, Munnar etc. in holidays.\n \nTo sum up, staying away from home during the holidays will not only give physical relief but also, give mental satisfaction.

For example, India is famous for its production of spices, fruits like Alphonso, apples, grapes and oranges.

There is a saying that suggests that \"history repeats itself\", for this reason, if we delve into history, examine it without leaving any detail behind, we will have more opportunities to anticipate forthcoming problems and it is undeniable that problems would be solved very easily. Human conflicts, inventions and socials issues in all the ages are quite similar and this is what makes the study of past so important. Without studying the past we cannot understand why a certain civilization flourished among others and why nations were destroyed. This knowledge can give us such a wisdom that would help us progress further.   \n\nHistory has a great importance in our lives, in spite of the fact that there are people who think the past is useless and there is no point in studying history. However, it is undoubtedly true that an explicit future awaits the one who has delved into history. Thus teaching history to the children needs to be considered comprehensively. Because if children are not taught history, there will be consequences. For instance, lack of knowledge of the past of their country would have a tragic outcome in the society.\n\nTo conclude, studying and examining the past has a fundamental value in the modern world and it is undeniable that the effects of the children who are not taught history would be more catastrophic than anyone could imagine.\n  [ Written by - Eldar Rehimli ]\n ", "original_link": "https://www.ielts-mentor.com/writing-sample/writing-task-2/1783-ielts-writing-task-2-sample-714-studying-the-past-has-little-value-in-the-modern-world"}, {"essay_topic": "In most countries disabled people are not catered adequately, e.g. buildings are often inappropriately designed.

Accident statistics in many states in the U.S. showed a substantial jump in the number of drunken driving accidents involving 18 to 20-year-olds.\n  Second, in reality, most young adults are still in high school when they are 18 years old and they do not have a job. Therefore, they are not ready for all of the physical and mental challenges that go along with being an adult such as raising a family or supporting themselves. For many parents, the term legal adult does not mean their children possess certain adult characteristics. For example, being an adult implies being able to make mature decisions, participate in civic matters, have self-control, and be responsible. Some 18-year-olds simply lack these characteristics and need further time to develop them. It is quite clear that when children turn to 21 years old, they have already been in colleges and have had some life experiences, therefore, they understand how to responsible for their actions.\n  In conclusion, 18-year-olds are not matured enough to be considered adults.

While some deem that public libraries have become obsolete, others are of the opinion that it still plays a pivotal role in society. In this essay, I will confer both views and provide an opinion.\n\nPublic libraries are open to everyone, be it to some civilian who has a sudden urge to put his foot up and get immersed in a book, or to students who are struggling with the thesis. They also provide books of many varieties, ranging from historical books to modern fictions.

Due to the rapid development of information technology, a group of people believe that the existence of libraries is not necessary, while others disagree. The following essay will explain in details regarding both contradictory opinions, but I do believe that libraries play an important part in our communities.\n  On the one hand, some people think the existence of traditional libraries is not effective and efficient anymore these days. With the development of computer and internet technology, people could find tens of thousands of references through the internet. Besides that, there is a new technology which is commonly called tablet PC, and people could read the electronic book through the device. Therefore, people do not have to bother themselves going to the library to find some articles.\n  On the other hand, for a number of reasons some people believe that traditional libraries should continue to exist. Firstly, it is believed that there are a lot of old books and references that contain historical values and they should be properly maintained in libraries. Secondly, several people prefer to read articles or books in the library, due to the library could offer a quiet and comfortable place for studying. They believe that they could focus and concentrate more in the place. Lastly, not all books are provided in softcopy or electronic versions, therefore people might still search books in libraries.\n  In conclusion, it is a fact that the existence libraries have been argued by a lot of people nowadays. Although with the assistance of internet and computer technology people do not have to go to libraries anymore, I personally think that traditional libraries still play an important part in our societies.\n  [ Written by -  Darwin Lesmana ]\n ", "original_link": "https://www.ielts-mentor.com/writing-sample/writing-task-2/1772-ielts-writing-task-2-sample-706-public-libraries-to-be-unnecessary-due-to-the-availability-of-the-internet"}, {"essay_topic": "Many people believe that professionals in certain fields like film, sports and music are heavily overpaid while other important professionals like doctors and teachers are poorly paid.", "extra_topic": "", "model_answer": "\nHuman beings always like entertainment. Entertainments are in many forms and among them the films, music and games are three most popular categories. Some people think that entertainers like film actors, sports professionals, musicians are the fortunate people who raise a big amount of money. While other believes that they are overpaid and there are other professionals who should earn more than they currently do because of their invaluable services to the people and society. In this essay, I will discuss both points of views.\n\nFirst of all, people always admire hard works either in films, dramas or in sport. When a character's performance gets fame, that increases the worth of the actor and he demands too much amount in exchange for work that is fair as they work round the clock to entertain the public. Secondly, all the entertainers are humans, they have families, relations and sufferings, as they work hard for the community; it is not possible for them to work in an office or start a business. So they must be paid high to nourish his family.\n  Not all entertainers are so lucky to become famous. There are numerous peoples who are entertaining the public but could not draw a handful amount because of not appreciable work and they are living from hand to mouth. Some unfortunate people are working in this profession and can\u2019t gain attention from the general public, so they are unable to earn well.\n  In my opinion, there are professions that need to be paid a high amount, because of their nature of work. For example, Doctors and Teachers; a doctor cures the patients and thus build the healthy society, as the fact is only a healthy nation can grow up in the world. Teachers educate a generation, which will be the future of the country.

The total number of audience and the importance of this game have evolved beyond boundaries in the recent times than ever, particularly in countries like India, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Pakistan etc. and I believe the number of reasons contributed towards this change is numerous. But it is undoubtedly arguable that the significance of cricket has crossed as that of the national games, in almost all these countries.\n\nBeing an Indian, I would consider my self-privileged to explain what happened in India which has, in turn, helped cricket to be a celebrated game. The national sport of India is declared as hockey and India always has had a wonderful hockey team now and in the past. But it is quite evident that during the mid-80s the exposure cricket had received internationally is commendable when compared to any other sport, so as in India too. Those days, hockey was also given similar importance but with India's victory of International Cricket Council's world cup in the early 90s, the dream of an Asian country winning an international title has become a dream come true for not only Indians but also for the other subcontinents in Asia. Ever since then, the players were treated as celebrities and apparently the popularity of the game has increased and as time has passed, India became one of the most successful and a record winning team in the entire world.\n\n\nAdding to the flavour, it would be insensitive, if I do not count the contributions of individual cricket players and their influence in the Indian community. Some players like Sachin Tendulkar and Saurav Ganguly has been an envied opening partnership for all other opponent countries, and they have been very successful in making and achieving new records day by day. Sachin Tendulkar alone holds more than 200 records in the game of Cricket and he is the most run scorer and century holder in all forms of cricket. Additionally, when we go back to the history of cricket it is worth mentioning that, cricket has its root of origin to England, and I presume being a colony to the English for around 200 years until 1947, cricket has got widely popularised during these days.\n\nIn summary, although, I have so many other reasons to be specifically pointed out, I consider the above said details are most significant to be told. However, I would be more than eager to witness what sport could possibly replace Cricket from its position in the future, as I believe change is inevitable and the world is dynamic.\n\n[ Written by -  Anoop Veliyath Asokan ]Model Answer 2:\nThe game of cricket has undoubtedly bowled over the native sports in the majority of the Asian and neighbouring continents. The popularity of the sport, as many suggests owes to the peculiarity of the game and the flamboyance of the players and team involved. Let us discourse the reasons below.\n\nIt is quite obvious that native sports in these countries lack the enthusiasm and some unique features which cricket does not. Moreover, national sports are not being played on a global perspective compared to cricket these days. In addition to this, the younger generations are influenced by the game of cricket from their childhood. For example, in India, seldom would you find one describe his childhood devoid of cricket. Hockey being the national sport of India, will find itself miles away on the road to popularity compared to cricket.\n\n\nOne other reason for its popularity would be the frequency of international tournaments or series that occur in the circle of cricket, whereas native sport does not acknowledge international viewers on such basis. As a result, cricket and its players splash around the media all the year around, making it closer the mass hearts. For example, the welcome that Australians received after winning the cricket world cup in 1996 acquired  a worldwide attention on television screens. The world witnessed India coming to a stand still on winning world cup following this.\n\nHistory favours the sub-continental countries teams to procure higher rankings in the cricket hierarchy, an illustrated reason for cricket\u2019s popularity in these continents. The fact that majority of the tournaments in world cricket hangs around the Asian subcontinent also adds to the heap of reasons. Asia cup, Sharjah cup etc. exemplifies the same.\n\n\nIn conclusion, the native sports are fading importance in the huge waves of roars applauding cricket. This phenomenon is getting more globalised and seems unstoppable. As a sports person myself, I opine that measures should be taken to promote the national sports because no sport is better than other unless played in the right spirit.\n\n[ Written by -  Vineeth V. ]", "original_link": "https://www.ielts-mentor.com/writing-sample/writing-task-2/1769-ielts-writing-task-2-sample-704-in-sub-continent-cricket-has-become-more-popular-than-the-national-sports"}, {"essay_topic": "Is it better for students to live at home with their parents or in school accommodation?", "extra_topic": "", "model_answer": "\nNowadays, many parents thought to decide that their children should stay at home and go to school.

There are many advantages that the teenagers will get when they live in the school accommodation, namely they will have new friends, more time to study and discussion and it learn to live independently and take responsibilities.\nFirstly, if the students live in school accommodation, they will have many different friends such as different regions, languages, customs, hobbies, background and current fields of study. Some scholar said living in the diversity helps the community think uniquely. I mean, they will have a better understanding than people who never build up the relationship with others in the community or even in the school. These students will also expand their knowledge because they are able to learn from others.\nFurthermore, group discussion is one of the important things that should be done by the students. In this group, they could meet their classmates or others having the same interest. More time is using to discuss the assignments or essays will impact to the ability and capability of the students. Group study is much useful because intellectually and behaviorally these students will change positively.\nLastly, the decision to stay at school dormitory means more independence to do everything such as cooking, washing, tidying up the bedroom, clearing the building, yard, etc. These kinds of activities will lead the students to be independent and responsible. To sum up, even though many people have different arguments about where is the best place for their sons and daughter: staying in school accommodation or living at home.

People have different views about the effects of advertising on our lives. In my opinion, there are both positive and negative impacts of advertising.\n  There are two main reasons why it could be argued that advertising has several benefits on our lives. Firstly, advertising plays an important role in the economy. Companies need to tell consumers about their products and services. Advertising informs us about the choices we have and the use of the products. For example, Kelling ' cornflakes have a variety of flavours for different ranges to offer for different age groups and now also for people want to lose weight, thus giving consumers different choice to select from. So, without advertising, we would have fewer choices.\n  Secondly, advertising is a creative industry that employs many people, therefore providing jobs opportunities and income for many people. So, without advertising, there would be higher unemployment rate.\n  On the other hand, it is understandable why some people might think that advertising is a negative part of our lives. One problem is that advertisers often aim their marketing at the young age groups. Children, for instance, can easily be influenced by advertisements. So this put pressure on their parents to buy them things by pestering and nagging. Another problem is that many advertisements manipulate people too badly. Capturing the minds of consumers is the main intention of the advertisements. Thus by persuading people that buying a product will make them happier and with higher social status.\n  In conclusion, there are convincing arguments both for and against advertising, but I believe there are both positive and negative aspects of advertising.

Clothes that are purchased today might be considered as old fashioned in the following semester. However, many people think that these rapid changes are set by fashion designers for commercial purposes. Therefore, people do not have to follow fashion style since it would only benefit fashion designers and manufacturers themselves.

By wearing an updated fashioned style might increase the self-confident level of the person who wears it. Besides that, clothing also might impact on business results as well.

Although there are some reasons that act as a catalyst to separate the people from a family, I believe this tendency can be changed through taking proper actions.\n\nCertainly, there are some causes that influence the people to detach from their household nowadays. Firstly, as earning money is one of the important for livelihoods that increases from last few years, men member of a house usually go to the outside of his own area for a job to maintain a happy lifestyle. As an example, many developing countries like India, China and Nepal don't have enough employment in the rural area; so, the village people have no choice but to endeavour the city area. Secondly, when most children finish their primary and high school education, they are now motivated by the popular university education; thus, they move to other countries or mega cities for studying. It is apparent that these changes happen due to the above reasons. People no longer prefer to live in a joint family and the number of nuclear families is increasing rapidly. The scarcity of resources, the increasing cost of life leading and decrease in family values are some of the main reasons for that.\n\nOn the other hand, some preventive measures we should take to eliminate this problem. Obviously, governments need to take a major share of responsibility if they want to change this situation. the Government can make industries, factories in the rural area, in fact, it should be ensured that every people of the state can easily obtain a suitable job in his local area. Moreover, a large number of facilities should be included in local school, college, and university so that the students will be impressed with their own education system. Furthermore, communication sectors such as mobile, the internet as well as the developed transportation system can play an important role. In case any member of a family necessitates to apart from their house they can still communicate with other members of the family. People should understand the value of family bonding and should have a positive mentality to stay together no matter what.\n\nIn conclusion, it is very consequential that people of the clan should live together because they need each other if they face any problem.

Some argue that increasing the price of fuel is the best way while others have different opinions and views. This essay, as my opinion leads to, takes an intermediate position through some considerations given below.\n  I personally believe that gasoline price must be increased. A massive number of vehicles run on the streets, whether it is a narrow one or a boulevard, contributes in some ways of traffic jam and also pollutions. Moreover, most of the cars owners on the road can be recognised, as most of them are wealthy. So the petrol price does not matter for them in most of the cases. The rocketed price of petroleum means less use of personal vehicles, especially for middle-class car owners. Improving the public transportation, on the other hand, would bring more or less, direct or indirect, better transportation facility for all. So, instead of increasing the fuel price, the authority should put more emphasis on enhancing the public transportation facilities, along with increasing the petrol price.\n  However, I believe that this solution must be accompanied by other attempts such as providing higher quality and quantity in public transportations. People need mobilisations as well as they need food and housings, recently so government should see these as a basic input for their service in transportation matter. For instance, the security for commuters is important. They want to be secure so government should provide security officer in appropriate number that could lead to convenient in reaching the destinations. They also need enough vehicles with short-scheduled arrivals so they will not come late to attend their meetings, for instance. Besides, there should be a high improvement in the quality of roads as well as the stations which should be added.

Case in point, kids from my school will not let Jaycea hear the end of it because she is friends with Elaine, a driver's daughter, notwithstanding the fact that Elaine is trustworthy and dependable.\n\nOn the contrast, I also believe that it is unreasonable to stereotype the whole society based on the behaviour and way of thinking of some people. Like the aforementioned case in which Jaycea is willing to befriend Elaine despite being bullied, it shows that it is possible for some people to value trust and generosity over social status.\n\nTo sum up, while it is commonplace for people to hold a higher value of material possessions and social status in this overcritical world, there are also people who value old fashioned values more and they are not to be overlooked.[ Written by - Jaclyn ]", "original_link": "https://www.ielts-mentor.com/writing-sample/writing-task-2/1758-ielts-writing-task-2-sample-694-a-person-s-worth-nowadays-seems-to-be-judged-according-to-social-status"}, {"essay_topic": "International marketing is sometimes seen as invasive and an intrusion into the country in question.

It is considered that these activities and abilities will not be necessary when the technology of a country is developed. While I accept that some certain skills and works are not essential, but I also believe that others are very important.\n  On the one hand, there are some good reasons why the traditional skills and ways of life are no longer required to keep them alive. Firstly, not only can technology work speedily but also it has many conveniences. As an example, in the past, although post office was very popular, it took a long time to deliver a letter. However, the e-mail has changed this boring system. Secondly, now people don\u2019t need to read the book in a conventional way like paper based since they can study various types of books through online. Thus, the traditional skills are no longer required in this modern era.\n  On the other hand, the traditional expertness and the related things are very important in many ways. One is handwriting, which is very indispensable for some nations. Some people think that it is the symbol of a good character of a person. Another is mathematics calculation, if people depend on the computer for simple mathematics calculation, this will reduce the intelligent of the people. For instance, a research has been published by Melbourne University that most people are becoming lazy due to the fact that the technology has developed. Therefore, it is clear from this example that traditional skills are essential.\n  In conclusion, after analysing the argument it seems that both points are significant.

I strongly feel that there is an urge to take a break from the intensity of technology, especially when the information we are looking for can be found in printed material. Who wouldn\u2019t miss out a bookstore atmosphere, interaction with a real, knowledgeable shop seller eager to provide personal recommendations on books? The smell of the ink, the rustle of the pages flipping through your fingers, embellishment of our rooms filled with literary pieces on our bookshelves? I personally can hardly envisage an electronic device used as a substitute for my books.\n\nTo flip the coin, it\u2019s undeniably true that newspapers, magazines in digital format are less time-consuming to get. Ebooks are not only easily portable and accessible, but also the prices for online books are much lower compared to the cost we pay for printed word. They avoid the hassle of waiting in the line and it\u2019s a huge time saver.

However, some people are convinced that these encoded information sources will continuously thrive for a long period of time.\n\nPrimarily, it can be argued that people, who lived for previous decades, have the traditional forms of gathering information. This information is those that can be read in the newspaper and the Encyclopedia.  Being adjusted to the presentation of information, there are some cases that elderly people and those who are very conventional might not abandon reading current affairs or ideas on paper. Furthermore, news headlines or activity books can be outlined and written. There could be circumstances that people read news which is those important affairs only. They use a pen to highlight ideas that would pique their interest. Likewise, some students need to write answers on their workbook to facilitate learning, thus it is disputable that information on paper will never become an obsolete method of obtaining knowledge.\n\nIn contrast, it can never be denied that e-books are reading materials which are handy and convenient. The procurement of information is at the convenience for most families because electronic references can be shared trough internet. The internet has various websites that have updated information. These recent data can be easily accessed by downloading in a form of electronic book. Secondly, information saved in a computer is not easily deteriorated because the data are displayed on the screen. It cannot be torn nor crumpled, and can indefinitely reproduce in multiple copies. For instance, the computer has a system that retains the file and can proliferate in a large number of copies.\n\nIn my opinion, I argue that the longevity of journals, literary and ideas on paper will survive in spite of existing e-books and online information.   It can be questioned that daily exposure to computer screens or computer books, which emits little radiation, may damage the reader\u2019s eyes. Some people who are less affluent may not have computers their residences, thus it is futile that they will alter the traditional mode of acquiring ideas.\n\nOverall, some are convinced that readable information on computers will eradicate encoded conventional publications.

Some people think that it is better for property developers to build more houses in existing cities, while others believe that it would be better to build new areas. The following essay will discuss both arguments in details.\n  It is a fact that the world population has grown rapidly nowadays which increased the demand for housing. It is believed that building more houses in the existing town is better than to expand to new areas. As most workplaces are located in cities surrounding, it would be better for residents to have accommodation which is located near to their work. However, many people do not realise that building more properties in the town means that the city would become denser and traffic congestion would become worst. As a result, air pollution become worst and it distracts the health condition of the residents.\n  On the other hand, developing new housing areas bring a lot of benefits for the people. Firstly, new towns or cities have a lower property price than those who are located in the city centre, therefore more people could own a house. Secondly, as some of the cities' people move to new towns, it would gradually reduce the density, air pollution and traffic problems in the cities themselves. Thirdly, by developing rural areas, it would develop the economic growth of the rural areas themselves, as there will be new commercial areas and new workplaces as well.\n  In conclusion, it is obvious that the demand for properties has risen due to the increase of the world population.

However, I firmly believe that it is obvious and fair that the payment of famous people like movie stars, pop musicians or sports champions have is much higher than the salaries of different other professionals.\n\nFirst of all, there is no doubt that the amount of payment of stars should be much higher than the amount of salaries of different kinds of work because people\u2019s salary depends on the profit of the business and the expense. For example, in order to produce a movie or sing a song or do some sports activity, usually, people do not spend a lot of money. However, when their work becomes famous they have a huge amount of salary because their work is very popular and many people buy this movie or go to the theatre to watch the famous film.\n\nThe next point that needs to be taken into consideration is that famous artists have huge salaries because of their works are special and exceptional. For example, no one has the same voice as Madonna or Celine Dion. Another example is that no one can act in a  play as can Antonio Banderas. Whereas, a lot of people can be accountants, lawyers or doctors. Many people can learn, who to do these kinds of job and simply repeat the work according to written and already adopted rules. For these reasons, special professions such as movie stars, sports legends or pop musicians should have a bigger salary than people from different professions.\n\nTo sum up, it is evident that famous people should have bigger remuneration that people who have different professions because they produce special and extremely popular work that impossible to copy by anyone else.

The artists are getting paid much more than anybody else. I strongly agree that they are getting higher wages in comparison to other sectors which deserves to be highly paid. This essay discusses the outrageous gap between performers and other professions and opinion about other jobs which should be well paid.\n\nTo begin with, entertainers\u2019 income does not reflect in their work. For instance, sports stars such as cricketers are getting a vast amount of money for playing the game besides their performance. However, the people who are spending their money in cricket for business purpose obviously are not hand over very well. So it is clear that salaries of performers do not match the job they perform at all.\n\nSecondly, artists' income can easily be distinguished from other professionals. Such as, the Hollywood superstar, Angelina Julie, can easily make one million dollars by participating in a single movie. In contrary, this number can never be achieved by workers of other industries. Apart from these entertainers, there are other sectors that deserve to be paid higher for their services. For example, teachers are in charge of education and moral character of next generation but considered underpaid. The other most important and foremost professional is a doctor who saves lives and gives hope to people by serving day and night should be paid off equal to the meaningful contributions they make.\n\nIn summary, entertainers do not offer anything greater than other workers. It is recommended that people who work hard should be rewarded appropriately so that the gap between stipends of different jobs should not be too significant.   \n  [ Written by - Samia Anam ]\n    Model Answer 3:\nMany entertainers' and sportspersons' payment scales have become a matter of controversy in these days. Though some people justify high pay scale of them, I feel that this is kind of unfair.\n\nOne obvious reason to support my view is that the entertainers and sportspersons do not deserve a great deal of remuneration than many other important professions that contributing to national development.   To be more precise, entertainers and other popular artists may not be doing any extra valuable things to society and country in terms of developments. At this juncture, they deserve only a certain level of payment, which definitely less than other valuable professions. Moreover, these highly paid sportsmen and entertainers do not assure to perform well in further assignments. The professions which contribute to society and nation must be paid a handsome amount of salary and other perks than the entertainment professionals.\n\n There is an opinion that the employment such as medical professions and scientists are to be paid more than any other profession. In other words, the professional are really contributing to society as well as nations development, regardless of gender and social status. Doctors and Nurses look after the health services of the country, scientist work for new inventions and discoveries, which enhance the nation's developments at the same time.\n\nHowever, an army of people argues that the entertainers and sportsmen are celebrities. So, they deserve good payment. Perhaps it may true, but we cannot deny that the valuable professions deserve more remuneration than entertainers.\n\nTaking everything into consideration, I feel that the high payment scale category must be replaced as medical professional and scientists, who are the real heroes of the nation.\n  [ Written by - Basil Pallath ]\n    Model Answer 4:\nNowadays, the pace of changes in the world of technology is amazing. These speedy changes lead entertainment industry to become ahead of many sectors in our lives. A fastest growing popularity of stars in different fields is a controversial topic that is discussed almost everywhere in the world. To my way of thinking, people who are getting fame in the 21st century are highly-paid workers.\n\nIn one hand, I reckon that people are equal in every aspect so as our professions. Owing to the fact that we can divide employment world into two sectors we will understand that professions that serve mass entertainment requirements and whose working process can be seen on television are highly profitable, compared to those who are working in offices for long hours. Consequently, people show them less respect. In fact, these kinds of professionals can be more beneficial for society as well as for government than those who are famous from televisions. For instance, if we compare architects salary to famous musicians or pop stars income we can vividly see a sharp difference between them. If a senior architect's whole year's income makes up approximately $70,000, a famous pop star can earn two times more money by performing in a single concert.  \n\nOn another hand, a vast majority of TV stars such as movie stars or even sports icons have appropriate financial rewards that accurately suit its working standards as well as their high professionalism. For instance, Emma Watson who is a worldwide famous star should have a high income. We cannot deny the fact that high financial rewards can encourage people to improve themselves in terms of career. Some people believe that this kind of attitude will lead our entertainment industry to industrial prosperity.\n\nIn conclusion, I would like to say that after discussing both sides of argument my sentiments are on par with the idea that entertainers who are famous from the blue screen should have equal financial rewards as people working at other important sectors.\n  [ Written by - Ana Petriashvili ]", "original_link": "https://www.ielts-mentor.com/writing-sample/writing-task-2/1751-ielts-writing-task-2-sample-688-professionals-of-other-important-sectors-are-comparatively-less-paid"}, {"essay_topic": "With the rise in popularity of the internet, newspapers will soon become a thing of the past.", "extra_topic": "", "model_answer": "\nAdvances in technology lead to the revolution in communication and media facilities.

In this essay, I will ask if winning always means that the others loose, and whether teaching our children to win is the best preparation for life.\n  Competition is undoubtedly good. First of all, it pushes us to do well, both as children and adults. Our physical limits are tested in competitive sports. Competition in business helps companies to produce new products and services, and competition in politics ensures that different opinions get heard and represented. For children, learning to compete is good preparation for the world. A second point is that competition does not just mean winning: children have to learn to lose well and to learn from their mistakes. In addition, competition does not just mean success for the individual. When competing as part of a team children learn the need to share and cooperate.\n  However, a focus on competitiveness is not always beneficial for children. To begin with, very young children are naturally egocentric. As a result, they have to learn that there are others around them. Children have to be taught the skills of cooperation and sharing. A further point is that by learning to cooperate and work in teams, children learn to share responsibility when things go badly as well as when they go well.

No matter how brilliant an individual is, his or her work is the result of working in a team or a community.

To sum up, it can be seen that television can be an alternative to learning.\n  Turning to the other side of the argument, watching television can affect children in a negative way. Firstly, a lot of films are created that are praised for the special effects, not for the underlying ideas. Thus, children may waste their time by enjoying only the views.  Secondly, generally speaking, offensive language and violence are used to make films more intense.

It is believed that the excessive usage of personal cars has caused congestion problems in big cities and therefore people should use public transportations more often. However, public transportations have their own positive and negative sides and the following essay will discuss them in details.\n  It is undeniable, that public transportations have some weaknesses. Some people still choose to use their own private vehicles, though the government has encouraged them to use public transports. It is because public transportations are not as safe as private cars and some criminal activities on public buses or trains such as pocket thieves are still being reported. And then public transportations are not reliable in terms of preciseness and accuracy. Many people have complained about the preciseness and the consistency of these public transportations schedules, which impacted to their work or study time.\n  Despite its weakness points, public transportations bring a lot of benefits for individuals and societies. Firstly, it is clear that the existence of public transportations will automatically reduce traffic problems. Secondly, if the utilisation of public transportations increased, it means that there will be a reduction in the consumption of fossil fuels. Consequently, it will reduce air pollution and global warming issues. Therefore, the governments should encourage their residents to use public transportations.\n  In conclusion, people have different opinions about public transportations. Some people enjoy using them, while others choose to use their own personal vehicles. Although public transportations have some weaknesses, I do believe that the benefits outweighed the drawbacks. I also suggest that the government should improve the public transportation services, therefore more and more people are attracted to use public transportations.\n  [ Written by - Darwin Lesmana ]\n    Model Answer 2: \nTransportation is playing an important role in every nation's development process and this is an important aspect of our life for mobility. Some people believe that private car is the best mean of transportation while others say that public transport service should be used for this purpose. However, as far as I am concerned, I firmly agree that public transport service should be our main mean of transportation. The advantages and demerits of using public transportation are discussed in this essay.\n  The very first advantage of using public transportation service is that it reduced the burning of fossil fuel. We all know that fuels like petrol and diesel take million of years to make. Therefore if we do not decrease the usage level of these fuels then in future it will be diminished. So to make sure that it will not happen in future, we need to save these fuels as much as possible. The very first step towards it is the usage of public transport service. Since a public transportation can carry a large number of passengers it reduced the overall fuel consumption. Thus it helps to reduce the air and environmental pollutions.\n  Secondly, more pollution will be generated if we opt to use private cars for transportation. The more personal cars on the road, the more pollution it will generate. So if we use bus or train for roaming then we can fulfil our part to decrease the environmental pollutions. Further, transportation cost is cheaper in the case of public transportation. Another aspect is the accident risk. In private cars, the probability of accident on road has increased dramatically. Last but not least, public transportation increases your social contacts. Your social life will scatter with the use of government transport service.\n  Every coin has two sides and that is true for the usage of public transportation as well. Firstly, public buses or trains take more time to travel to some place. It does not take any shortcuts and also runs in limited speed. On the other hand, with a private car, you can go to any place in a very short time. Secondly, public transport service is limited. One has to make sure that he/she has the timetable of public buses or trains. If one does not have timing record, then it generates some hurdles for the travellers. There is little privacy on public transportation and you can\u2019t relax in a crammed public bus or train.\n\nAll in all, I would conclude by saying that public transport service has more advantages than its disadvantages. Further, I like to suggest that buses or trains should our main transportation types. Private cars should be used for urgent needs only. Otherwise, public transportations should be used. It will save our environment.\n  [ Written by - Satwinder Singh ]\n ", "original_link": "https://www.ielts-mentor.com/writing-sample/writing-task-2/1738-ielts-writing-task-2-sample-678-what-are-the-pros-and-cons-of-using-public-transport"}, {"essay_topic": "Visitors who visit other countries should follow the local customs and behaviours or the host country should welcome the cultural diversity and allow visitors\u2019 own custom and behaviours.

The tourism industry has become a matter of concern and significant investment has been injected to develop impressive destinations for tourists. But there are a lot of debates about conflicts which come into existence when a number of people intend to enter into other societies. Two groups of people opine differently. One group believes that tourists should follow customs, rules and behaviours of host countries. On the other side, the second group of people believe that tourists should bring modern lifestyle and tradition in order to improve their lifestyle. This issue will be analysed in detail and suggestion will be provided for this sophisticated matter in the following section.\n\nInterestingly, some people believe tourists should follow customs and rules of host countries. The reason behind this is that they are worried about changes in their lifestyle and customs because they do not want to interrupt their customs by outsiders. If tourists bring their behaviour and rules then local people are likely to copy their lifestyle and dress wearing habits. For instance, Saudi Arabia is one of the strict countries that don\u2019t show western dresses like short ladies dresses and alcohol is also strictly prohibited.  Its main motive is to refrain local people to adopt foreigners\u2019 way of living style.\n\nHowever, on the other hand, many people believe that tourists should allow bringing their behaviours, rules and customs with them when they are tourists in other countries and the host country should welcome their lifestyle and tradition. For instance, Emirates is one of the Muslim countries but it welcomes all customs and traditions. For example, Europeans are allowed to drink alcohol and ladies are allowed to wear short dresses. Moreover, tourists also wish to look like local in any country and they desire to wear local dresses like in Muslim countries ladies wear specific dresses. Tourists also find chances to introduce their culture diversity and customs. Tourist industry should make potential to provide full freedom and they feel like own homeland. Furthermore, tourists are an important source for host countries to increase national income substantially.\n\nIn conclusion, tourists can have excellent tourism experience by respecting others religion, culture and tradition.

The certain organisations get lofty money from tourism and invest the gained money to this business activity again. Subsequently, the available process persists protractedly.

To control the ever increasing population many people believe that Government can control the population through taxes.", "extra_topic": "", "model_answer": " \nIt is true that the population increases tremendously in many countries in these days, and this causes different types of problems in the earth. That is why many people believe that government should augment the taxes to the family, who has the more children than the certain number. While I accept this policy may have some detrimental effects on the human life, I believe it is more auspicious than harmful.\n\nOn the one hand, there are some good reasons why increasing taxes can bring some inconveniences to the people. Firstly, people have their own choice and right because they are independent and free to adopt any decision about their personal life; so, no one can influence them. Secondly, the difference between the rich and poor would be increased in the sense that the richer people may take the children above a certain amount through their money. This could result in immense embarrassment to the rich and poor people. Finally, governments may apply the alternative solution to control the population such as the advertisement, education, free contraception device and so on, which are maybe more substantial. Thus, it is clear that this idea has some drawbacks.\n\nOn the other hand, increasing tax is one of the most efficient ways in which the state can easily control the population. All regimes have the full authority to take any useful decision about their country when the government faces any practical problem. Moreover, if the government takes this intensive decision to raise the tax, the people of the country will discourage to take more children. As an example, since the government of China has already applied this method, they are now successful in controlling the over slums. Therefore, this instance makes it clear that the administration can manage the overpopulation through this significant action.\n\nIn conclusion, governments have the power to take necessary steps to prevent the excess population.

Using of unique clothing, ordered by managers, can have some influences, and I believe that the positive effects are more considerable, helping people to have better unity, responsibility, and the company would have better productivity.\n \nFirstly, wearing a particular cloth can raise workers to have more harmony. Clearly, wearing different colours or patterns of clothing can induce employees to have different opinions about their duties, while those wearing one specific uniform usually prefer to follow the group and have less conflict with other colleagues. In this way, as a doctor working in a hospital, I feel more correlation and have better feeling with hospital crews the day I wear my white coat than when I use the regular one.\n \nSecondly, it assists crews to be more responsible. Obviously, to reach their goals, they will always try to think as a member of a group when they use individual clothing, and they undertake their duties accurately. For example, The United Nation employees, who always wear a unique uniform, would not achieve their goals to control the propagation of Ebola virus in Africa. Although their nationality was different, their wearing was one of the several reasons that increased their responsibility, and they succeeded.\n \nFinally, this method can enhance productivity. Statistically, reported by an international economy magazine, those organisations imposing strict rules on their employees to use uniform have a higher rate of production and sales. When workers wear the same cloth, they motivated to work harder, causing companies to have more highly quality and quantity of goods; however, in those businesses people using different clothing usually have less productivity.\n \nIn conclusion, having harmony in crews' clothing, enterprises earn more profits.

In this essay, we will discuss the point of views for establishing where the responsibility for the protection of the environment lies.\n\nThere is a strong argument that individually we cannot contribute materially to the cause of preserving our environment because it encompasses several areas where individual efforts become futile. Some examples are factories that are emitting hazardous gases in our air or dumping dangerous materials in our rivers. If we want to take this up as an individual we cannot be expected to be able to prevent this from happening. One could argue that if each shareholder puts pressure on the companies that they own this could lead to building up of pressure for being more responsible, this, unfortunately, is not workable because usually the companies are mostly owned by funds that are managed by professionals, seeking profit and environment is very low on their priority list.\n\nThe above leads us to deduct that if this movement of preserving our environment is a collaborative effort by the government and general public we stand a better chance of being successful. The government should provide the legal infrastructure to control the natural instinct of profiteering of all investment institutions; with this, the individual efforts could start making the difference. Continuing the above example if an individual member of the society notices that same happening in his or her surroundings, he or she can call on an implementation agency that would tackle the factory emitting hazardous gases and dumping dangerous materials. Examples of these implementation agencies include Environment control desk in the city office, environmental inspectors who randomly visit such factories and are empowered under the law to impose a fine or completely seal the production facility found in violation of the rules.\n\nThe responsibility surely seems to be tilting towards the actions of individuals supported through government agencies and legislative framework, thus, in my opinion, the combined efforts of the government and public would be more effective. This should not, however, be interpreted as being absolved from keeping our environment clean and we can through cans and other non-degradable materials on the beach.\n\n[ Written by - Shakeel Haider]\n\nModel Answer 2:\nIn the contemporary world, the concern for the degrading environment is at the peak. Some people believe it is difficult for an individual to make a difference, while others feel it cannot be solved without authorities intervening in the matter. This essay will discuss both sides in-depth and will also state why I strongly agree that the government have an indispensable role in such matters.\n\nTo begin, many believe the task of saving mother nature is tedious for a single person. But if we introduce minor alterations to our day-to-day activities, we could probably eradicate the detrimental causes to our environment. For instance, we can always bring along a recycling bag while shopping so that usage of the plastic bag would decrease. These will definitely help in minimising the air pollution caused by burning plastic bags. Thus, such actions from an individual could lead to a healthy environment.\n\nIn contrast, to individual actions, governments also play a vital role in providing checks to many such activities disrupting our ecosystem. Governments can impose stringent rules to be followed by its people. For example, the usage of plastic bags should be completely banned in the country, and this can only be forced by authorities. These regulations require judiciary powers to implement which reside with the respective officials. For this reason, the government plays the cardinal part in a process of abolishing effects causing damage to nature.\n\nTo conclude, environmental degradation is increasing at an enormous rate. These problems should be tackled with the collaboration of an individual along with governments. Would it be ungreat? I firmly acknowledge the governments have a prominent role in resolving these issues.\n\n[Written by - Sumeet] ", "original_link": "https://www.ielts-mentor.com/writing-sample/writing-task-2/1733-environmental-problems-are-too-big-for-individuals-to-solve"}, {"essay_topic": "Newspapers have an enormous influence on people\u2019s opinions and ideas.

Although some individuals think that women cannot become prosperous militants or members of the police force, I personally think that their roles in these sectors are definitely crucial.\n\nOn the one hand, some believe that females must not be given equal opportunity to work in the police force or army. One reason behind it is that women have less physical abilities than men. Having Estrogen hormones, they usually are less capable of achieving their goals in these kinds of jobs. For example, to jump from a two-storey building, men are more powerful than women physically, and to arrest criminals, they are not as successful as men. In addition, emotionally they are less fitted than the male ones to participate in missions. In many occasions, they might be sent to battlefields to fight against drug dealers, smugglers, or even escaped prisoners, but they might not tolerate difficult situations, like facing severely injured people or horrible accidental scenes. As a result, men have better potentials not only physically, but mentally to work as a militant or policeman.\n\nOn the other hand, I personally think that both genders must equally be given the same opportunity to have these kinds of jobs. One factor behind it is that have been better critical thinkers. Obviously, they have shown their roles to defend their country during the war. As a prime example, British women officers were extremely prosperous to expose the Germans` schemes in World War II. Had they been not allowed to participate in the army plans, Europe would not have defeated Germany. Furthermore, to control crime, women must be hired in police force. Clearly, their roles are really important in those societies that males are restricted to touch females. In particular, in Iran, as a prime discipline, policemen are not permitted to touch the female offenders due to Islamic prohibitions; therefore, the government has given the green line to women to have equal opportunity to work in this kind of job.\n\nIn conclusion, while some may agree that females cannot become a perfect officer or army personnel, I completely disagree with them.

I personally believe that this system should be stopped as it would make poor countries poorer while rich countries would be richer in long run.\n\nFirst, poor countries can produce only a handful number of talented people each year through their broken economic and educational system. The government and public money are spent to support those students and professionals and when they are ready to serve the country, rich nations actually hijack them. This is quite unethical and a majority of the migrated professionals serve the migrated countries than the countries they were born. This system allows the developed countries to have a large number of talented professionals, scientists, writers, engineers, doctors and so on while poor countries suffer from the scarcity of such experts. These talented and qualified people are the keys to the development of a poor country and they should serve their motherland.  \n\nSecond, a developed country already has a large number of skilled labours and expert workers and they can do quite well without alluring skilled professionals to come and work there.  For instance, the number of native astronomers and scientists in the United States is already huge and they could easily do without brain draining talented and skilled professionals from other countries. Rich countries have a natural obligation to actually send their proficient workers to work and train citizens of poor nations for the betterment of the world. Employing skilled labours from other countries is actually a practice that ruins the equilibrium of development in the world.\n\nFinally, many skilled labours that migrate to the first world countries often end up working in a sector which is simply irrelevant to their education and skill and hence is a wastage of talent and time. For instance, many doctors and engineers in first world countries actually work in a restaurant or drive a cab only because they were migrated from poor countries and failed to show their worthiness.

This essay delves with the both viewpoints and finally express my own opinion.On one hand, parents and teachers usually set some rules for the children and they expect the children to follow these rules. In most of the cases, parents and teachers set rules that are helpful and beneficial for the children.

However, we now know that it was quite a good habit that our mother instilled in us.

Both views have their own advantages and disadvantages, and the following essay will discuss in details, but in my personal opinion, I do believe that the old-fashioned ways are better.\n\nTo begin with, many farmers are using technology and scientific approaches to managing their farms these days. They believe that by using technology such as tractors and dozers or using advanced chemical fertiliser, it will increase their productivity. However, many people do not realise that the usage of these advanced technological approaches has some side effects. For example, many fruits and vegetables that use pesticides have caused allergic diseases in human beings. And then, the over usage of pesticides in farming has made pests became more immune and made the ecosystem became imbalanced.\n\nOn the other hand, some farmers are still using the old-fashioned ways. They manage their plantations using traditional tools such as using cows, horses and traditional carts. And they prefer to use natural seeds, rather than using special seeds, which was created by scientists. Although the productivity of these farms is definitely lower, they generate healthier foods for mankind. As a result, many people prefer to purchase organic fruits and vegetables nowadays, as they realise that qualities of these organic foods are better than the industrialised ones.\n\nIn conclusion, it is a fact that some farmers are in favour of using advanced technology and scientific approaches in handling their farms, while others still use the traditional ways. Both approaches have their own benefits and drawbacks, but in my opinion, traditional ways are still better than the modern one, as organic foods are healthier for consumption.\n\n[ Written by - Darwin ]Sample Answer 2:\nThis global population explosion has reduced the farming lands and has overwhelmingly increased the demand for food. To accord with the demand, many have already adopted intensive animal farming and creation of fruits while others still follow the traditional ways of farming. Both approaches have merits and drawbacks but to feed the hungry mouths, scientific approaches to produce more food should be welcomed with proper research.\n\nTo begin with, traditional farming produces fresh and hygienic food that have a proper nutrition. This approach also keeps the land fertile and do not make animal stocks that have been genetically modified. Consuming farm-fresh fruits and organic food is the secret to have a healthier life. However, the food production in this procedure is costly and sluggish.   \n\nOn the contrary, the world population has already reached to over 7.6 billion and it is increasing rapidly. More population means fewer lands for cultivation. From this regards, I believe that scientific methods for producing more food at a reduced price is a timely demand. Intensive animal farming or industrial livestock production maximize production while minimizing production costs and this is a necessary step to feel the global food demand, I believe. To cite an example, the majority of the rural households in developing countries had farming lands and animal stocks to meet the demand for the family. These lands are shrinking to accommodate new family members and most of these households now rely on food items purchased from the market. If farmers do not adopt technology and scientific methods to produce more, people would starve. \n\nTo conclude, we should employ scientific methods to support the development of agriculture at the current era where food demand is higher than any other time in the history, but proper research should be in place to ensure hygiene and quality of these productions.", "original_link": "https://www.ielts-mentor.com/writing-sample/writing-task-2/1723-some-people-support-development-of-agriculture"}, {"essay_topic": "Some people think the cheap air flight gives ordinary people more freedom.

It is customary that employees in directorship and managerial positions often requires years of experience while some people opine that young should be given the chance to lead a company. I cannot agree with this group of people as I believe that those decision-making  positions are more suitable for experienced people.\n\nTo start with, directors or managers of an organisation were not directly appointed to these positions in most of the cases. They had to work for the company for several years, prove their worth, show their loyalty, establish their credibility and express their ability to be promoted to those senior positions. With the time, they have become quite experienced and learned from their mistakes. Thus their experience and expertise have taught them when to take a risk and when not to and how to tackle complex situations like riots or rivalry from the competitors. Due to this, decisions made and initiatives taken by those senior employees are more trustworthy and proven than any inexperienced employee, no matter how energetic or innovative he is!\n\nFurthermore, young people have endless spirit, fresh perspectives, technological know-how and innovative ideas which are more fitting for producing better output than leading others. They should be guided by senior leaders who had once been young and fresh but now have more experience than energy. To cite an example. most of the IT firms have young employees but their team leads are mostly seniors. Again, young people are often driven by emotion and make quick decisions. This might be quite handy in facing some minor issues but when a large organisation's fate is concerned, the decisions should come from experienced executives. This, however, does not mean that a manager should not listen to young employees and take input from them.\n\nFinally, leading a small team in an organisation and being an executive director in a large company are not the same thing. Young adults who have some leadership qualities should be allowed to lead a team but major decisions making positions should be held by deserving experienced personnel.\n\nTo sum up, I am not against letting young people take some responsibilities or lead a small team.

That is, if they have to pay for road transport, it creates the feeling of \u2018ours\u2019 and as a result, they avoid harsh driving and become more concern about roads.

While some people advocate that this development will help raise public awareness regarding the issue, others believe celebrities instead make the problem less important than it ought to be. I will discuss both views and then state my opinion.\n\nOn the one hand, some people believe celebrities dilute the importance of the problems. There have been many cases where the involvement of a celebrity only serves as tabloid materials rather than educates the public about the issue, especially when the celebrities\u2019 main motive is to promote their name. For example, a model once published a series of her nude photos, citing her opposition to the illegal poaching of animals in Africa as the main motive, but never mentioned anything about how serious the issue of illegal poaching was in following interviews.\n\nOn the other hand, it is undeniable that celebrities are ideal candidates to alert the mass people to the pressing issues, if for no other reason than their unparalleled diverse audiences. The large fan base of famous people is very likely to support the good cause that their idol endorses. In addition, celebrities can gather huge media coverage, and as a result, even people who are not their fans can be aware of the problem. Such attention-catching ability is very important to spread the message about international aid needed.\n\nHaving evaluated both sides of the argument, my conclusion is that the charity organizations can harness the celebrities\u2019 star power, at the same time combat the afore mentioned problem by choosing their spoke person wisely, so that the ambassador sincerely has the best interests of the troubled people or animals at heart, and not to divert public attention to himself.\n\n[ Written by - Thao Nguyen ]", "original_link": "https://www.ielts-mentor.com/writing-sample/writing-task-2/1718-ielts-writing-task-2-sample-659-when-famous-people-support-international-aid-general-public-think-about-it"}, {"essay_topic": "It is often cited that \u201cNot everything that is learned is contained in books\u201d.

Knowledge can be obtained from life experiences or from reading books. In my opinion, one cannot depend on either of the two in isolation. The best is to make use of both at times of need.\n\nFirst and foremost, before an individual is able to read and write, one must obtain knowledge through life experiences.

Therefore it is wise to spend more money to prevent illness than to spend on curing people who are already ill.    \n\nIn recent years, many countries have made a decision to spend a large proportion of money on disease prevention rather than the treatment of current patients. Yet, there remains some disagreement as to whether this strategy has been positive or negative. While there are certainly valid arguments to the contrary, I personally believe that more money should spend on prevention than treatment. There are two primary reasons for this.\n\nFirst of all, it is an indisputable fact that infection diseases are spreading fast. Consequently, tackling this problem is difficult without stopping the source of disease. For instance, some countries from West Africa have suffered from Ebola since last year. Despite the numerous of medicine and money that came from deferent countries and organisation most of the patients died. Thus, promoting the healthy lifestyle might be the best way to solve this situation. In other words, making vaccination will help countries to deal with many diseases.\n\nFurther and even more importantly, though, low level of health education and lack of exercises are responsible for such ailments as high blood pressure, obesity and heart diseases. However, by spending money to increase the level of understanding health problems in society can reduce the morbidity rate. Moreover, the increasing number of green areas in cities may encourage people to do outdoor sports and also allow people to breathing fresh air.

These meaningful arguments will be analysed with precise logic before presenting a reasonable conclusion.\n\nOn the one hand, today, some hold the idea that children should not waste their valuable time in order to do some kind of paid employments for several reasons. Firstly, children need concentration because it is crucial for education. When any student get involves with paid service, these children will lose their enthusiasm, and possibly most of the children will not be able to return to schools and university. Secondly, higher education in some countries is very competitive in terms of the number of the university in the sense that some countries have a few numbers of universities. Thus, children should not embark with jobs.\n\nOn the other hand, it is agreed that children can get indispensable work experience and can learn responsibility while they will work with paid service. Not only can the children become skills, but also they will earn a lot of money. As long as they want to study at higher education level, this money is essential for children. As an example, the students of the western countries such as the USA, the UK, Australia, Canada etc. are engaging with the paid service since the tuition fees of these countries are very high. Moreover, the early work experience teaches the children about responsibility, which may have brought immense boon of their future life. Therefore, children should endeavour some types of jobs besides of their education.\n\nIn conclusion, it is explicit that the both views are essential for children.

However, others choose to commute by bus, train and subway. In this essay, I will discuss both points of views, following what is my perspective on the matter.\n  Among the advantages of using your own car, is the freedom to travel. A person who owns a car can plan his destination and time. This proves that the owner can utilise and saves time while he travels. Having a private car also provides safety and comfort to the owner which cannot be achieved in a public car. On the contrary, if more people own private cars, it will just add problems regarding traffic jams. In addition, driving cars can also harm the environment due to the emission of extra greenhouse gases from fuels.\n  For the other people, using a public transport like buses, trains and subways are preferred in going to offices, schools and so on. It is indeed that commuting a bus or train is much cheaper and can save a lot of money than having own car. Another factor is that you have more time to relax as a passenger and also if more people are using public cars, damaging the environment will be less because of less pollution. On the other side of the argument, public transit can be noted to be inconvenient and often time\nconsuming.\n  In conclusion, though owning a car can give someone freedom to travel, I would still choose to ride a public transit.

Few individuals choose to travel by their own vehicles like cars. However, the others opt for public transportations like the train, bus or metro rail. Both these type of transportations have its own benefits and drawbacks. In this essay, I will discuss it and try to provide my opinion.\n\nTo begin with, if a person uses his own transportation then he will not need to wait for the availability of the vehicle like public transportation. Also, he can reach the destination quickly if he needs as he may increase the speed of his vehicle. Generally speaking, people who travel by their own vehicles reach their target on time and therefore they are more punctual. Thus, people find private transportation is more reliable and faster way to travel from source place to destination place.\n\nOn the other hand, people, who use public transportation, can experience their travelling with ease because they do not have to worry about the stringent traffic and driving rules. In fact, they can listen to their favourite music or check their official emails via smartphones or even they can read the newspaper. Additionally, public transportation costs lower than the private transportation. What is more, public transportations carry many people at the same time so it makes low pollution compared to private travelling. Hence, public transportation is considered as convenient, cost-effective and environment-friendly travelling.\n\nIn conclusion, although private transportations provide flexible travel, freedom and quick access to the vehicle, I believe, public transportations are far better than private transportations in terms of the convenience and incurred expenses of the travelling.\n\n[ Written by - Alpesh Bhoi ]", "original_link": "https://www.ielts-mentor.com/writing-sample/writing-task-2/1712-ielts-writing-task-2-sample-655-some-people-prefer-to-travel-around-town-by-car"}, {"essay_topic": "Children in many countries are eating more fast food and convenience snacks.

Although, such food has less nutritional value when compared to the homemade items, but still, the trend of eating fast food is catching fast among the younger generation.

Furthermore, more fast food shops are being opened every day at every corner of the street and these shops are easily approachable and reasonably priced. Thus children these days are trying these options and the fast food consumption is increasing fast.

There are a number of reasons that fast food is very popular among them, but this has led to very negative impacts on the health of the young ones.\n  One of the core reasons, which have immensely affected the fragile minds of the young ones, is advertisements. The visuals and presentation of junk food in advertisements are very attractive and appealing, as children tend to opt for junk food over homemade food. Also, the fast food chains are easily approachable these days as compared to earlier times. Another important reason is the lack of parental control of children, due to their busy office schedules these days. Parents often pamper their children by increasing their pocket money and full filling all their needs, which as a result make children to follow their own liking.\n  The habit of consuming more and more junk food can be very dangerous for the health of the young ones, as the nutritional value of such food is very low in comparison to homemade food. The use of chemical preservatives in junk food may cause serious health problems. In a survey, it has been found that children consuming more junk food are prone to obesity and have weak immune system, which is a serious issue.\n  In conclusion, junk food has become a convenient option for the young generation due to its abundance and fancy advertisement, but it has severe consequences on the health of the young ones.

They believe that they can be better rewarded if they work in large metropolitan and foreign countries where their skills and talent is in high demand. Relocating to foreign countries is beneficial in terms of exchange rates. For instance, due to higher currency exchange rates skilled worked and professionals in sub-continent prefer to work in different countries in the Middle East region to make both ends meet. People immigrate due to lack of employment, academic institutions, infrastructure services and high crime rate. Relocations provide the quality of life, ample employment opportunities, diversity in life which they cannot have while living in their hometown. Moreover, working in multinational countries often located in prestigious cities and countries can ensure a successful and long-lasting career and they believe they can return something back to society in future.\n  However, migration is not always beneficial and has its own challenges. People relocating to other cities are a complete stranger and it takes times to adapt to new environment and mix with people coming from different background, race and cast. They are not familiar with their cultural norms and traditional values which can be challenging for them. Moreover, the language barrier can prevent them from socialising and progressing in the society. Their families back home are often left alone to deal with everyday life challenges and can result in family destruction. People in sub-continent generally prefers to relocate back once they observe their children adapting to negative values of foreign culture where the new generation finds it very difficult to adjust with local culture and impact relationships. It also impacts the economic growth of the region where high profile people generally migrate leaving other to contribute their part.\n  To recapitulate, the aforementioned provides plausible arguments over merits and demerits associated with relocation.

Few people believe that one should continue with the existing employer, while others believe that switching jobs make them more competent. This essay will analyse both sides of the argument before presenting an opinion.\n\nFew people believe that it is good for the employees to continue working for their current employer throughout their life span. Proponents of this viewpoint believe that senior employees know the operations and functional nature of their job well which can be fruitful for the company. Their seniority and long term association make them entitled to incentives like gratuity, pension, extended leaves, loans and so on which can be of great value in future. Moreover, working with the same company improves employee and employer relationship and they can move through the hierarchy to attain managerial positions often reserved for credible and senior most employees. For instance, during a recession, companies retain their senior workforce and often newly hired staff ar laid off for cost cutting. Furthermore, they are settled in their existing job and switching workplace can disturb their life. There is no harm in continuing with the same job as long as the company is financially stable and an employee is getting the right exposure.\n\nOn the contrary, another school of thought believes that people should switch workplace once they feel that their career path is getting saturation and they are not learning new skills. Switching jobs, especially during the early phases of career, is instrumental in getting financial boosts as the employee gets more incentives and a better salary structure. Moreover, few multinational companies prefer employees having diversified experience of working in different industries which are vital for their growth. Furthermore, companies feel that an employee is getting more dependent on them and lack the courage and required skills to explore other job opportunities which can be exploited for their own good.\n\nTo recapitulate, the aforementioned provides plausible arguments in favour of both views.

Actually, the media is playing a vital role in increasing the popularity of sports stars and to make them popular among people so that they can get huge amounts in shape of salaries.\n\nSome people believe that sports players are receiving excessive big salaries and they have become extravagant compared to doctors and scientists and which is unfair. Therefore, sports players are not contributing or taking any part to provide helpful services in order to give advantages to people. But still, their salaries are immensely high. However, scientists and doctors\u2019 salaries are far less than sports players.

Life-threatening risks are taken by those players and life is in danger while performing a live stunt. For instance, a motorbike rider puts his life in danger and climbs to jump from a mountain to hit his mark. Furthermore, a skydiver jumps from the aeroplane and takes a huge risk of life only to amuse public. Moreover, they practice numerous times to become experts no matter which game they intend to perform in front of the camera. Therefore practice is likely to be long run or short run but still they give every effort to win an ordinary competition and to show impressive and distinctive performance to break the record of previous players. For this purpose, they also spend huge money to buy a lot of equipment and they spend many nights and days keep practising.

A section of the society believe that prison sentences for a longer duration can help reduce the crime, whilst others disagree and argue that there are other better ways to solve this. This essay agrees with the argument that alternative ways such as educating people and giving them resources to earn are far more beneficial than confining them to a prison cell. This essay will discuss both points of view.\n\nTo begin with, many people believe that offenders should be punished with long prison sentences because this phenomenon can invoke fear among other criminals. In other words, if a person is already aware of the intensity of punishment before committing any crime, it will discourage him from becoming a criminal. For example, in the UAE, the rapist and the murderer usually get lifetime prison sentences, resulting in making people think twice before committing any serious crime. Hence, imposing strict punishment deters people from committing atrocities.\n\nHowever, I believe that alternative ways such as providing proper education facilities and employment can solve the issues far more effectively. Sufficient education and job opportunities keep the masses busy and away from crimes. To exemplify, in Sweden education is free for everyone and the country\u2019s authority is continuously working for more employment opportunities. That is the reason why Sweden tops the list of peaceful countries where the crime rate is almost ignorable.\n\nIn conclusion, longer prison terms certainly instil fear in the minds of potential criminals and discourage them from committing offences.

However,  there are a handful of people assert that women should be more responsible in raising children as they make better parents than men which I disagree with.\n  A recent study has shown that women are comparatively more patient than men.  Thus, it suggests that women have the obligation to educate their children; for example, teaching them how to solve mathematical problems. This is because they have more patience than men do, hence their children will probably learn more efficiently from their mother than father. In addition, it is proven that, in general, more fathers will scold their children whenever they make a mistake without telling them what they have done is wrong. Nevertheless, a mother will explain clearly what the fault is and what should be done to tackle the problem to their children.\n  On the other hand, men have indispensable roles in guiding their children to the right path of their future lives. In most of the family, father acts as a good role model to their sons and daughters. The statistic from a recent research conducted in Singapore explains that children especially the boys have a higher tendency to commit crimes when they are not live a nuclear family. This can be due to the reason that they have no father as the role model who will teach them the good values. In short, men have no exception in playing a greater role in educating children.\n  In conclusion, children will be a successful and educated citizens only if both the parents willing to educate them dedicatedly and patiently.

They do not realise that research has proved that some of the rich people are not really happy in their life. On the other hand, many people consider happy when they have a harmonious family. They do not need much money to be happy, because by having a good husband, wife and children, they can feel satisfied.\n\nIn conclusion, I think that every people have their own definition of what happiness is.

Although this might be a good sign that the overall health has improved, it also brings some issues to the world. The essay will discuss the downsides of having ageing populations, as well as the solutions to combat these problems.\n\nThere are two disadvantages of having the ageing population. Firstly, the elderly would need more retirement fund than it might be previously expected, because they might need to rely on their pension for an extended period of time, such as for twenty years instead of merely fifteen years. Sadly, a recent survey reported that older people do not prepare sufficient funds to pay for their post-retirement expenses. As such, they might end up having financial problems later in life. Secondly, society might need more space for housing as the number of people living in this world continues to rise. This, in turn, might cause land or house prices to rise, making it less affordable for people to purchase.\n\nNevertheless, there are some measures that could be implemented to alleviate the negative effects. One of them is to provide affordable nursing homes so its cost will not be too burdensome to the family or the elderly themselves. This should also be supported by the growth in aged-care professions to ensure the welfare of the aged. In addition, superannuations need to be updated to suit the current condition of the ageing population. An example of this would be to start a campaign to promote early investment plan and financial savings. Hence, the young or the middle-aged can start preparing their retirement funds in order to accumulate enough savings to finance themselves.\n\nIn conclusion, while there are some issues brought by the higher life expectancy, there are some methods to solve the problems.

So whose duty is it to make it right again?\n\nTo start with, the ratio of crime and terrorism is being so increased exponentially. People feel unsafe, even being in their own homes. Criminals show no compassion or mercy to those who are being held by them as captives. I do not know what they get by doing such heinous and diabolical acts. In my opinion, the death penalty should be made as an essential punishment for those criminals and insurgents who love to annihilate the humanity or the society we live in, where people get massacred brutally just like flies in the air. The good example of this is in most of the middle-eastern countries where criminals get beheaded or hanged publicly for their wrongdoings, that is why their crime ratio is equivalent to almost zero. Crime is, after all, a crime, irrespective of how big or small it is. By this, I mean that adopting such policies might frighten those criminals and make them think at least ten times before bringing any kind of furore among citizen and annihilate them.\n\n\nOn the other hand, many people or activists think that criminals are also humans so they also deserve another chance to rectify themselves to become a better citizen in future.\n\nFrom these facts, I would maintain that no human being happens to be an insurgent, criminal or terrorist by birth.

Considerably, car ownership has displayed unprecedented growth over the past three decades. This has consequently led to the heavy congestion of traffic. According to my perspective, governments can definitely initiate some suggestive measures to control this menace.\n\nCommencing the discussion, the purchase and use of private cars have shown tremendous development over the past few decades. There are numerous reasons for which many individuals want to own private cars and freedom of commuting is perhaps the most important of them. Many also express immense enthusiasm concerning the new cars launched in the market as they come with new features, technology, safety measures and luxury. Consequently, the number of cars on the roads is increasing fast and it creates more traffic congestions than the roads and commuters can tolerate. Moreover, many authorities in developing countries bother the least to build more roads, suitable parking lots and their action further worsen the traffic problems.\n\nFurther reinforcing my perspective, governments can take some stringent measures to reduce car ownership and control traffic congestions. Firstly, the administration should emphasise building adequate parking lots, new roads and flyovers to reduce the traffic jam pandemonium while also campaigning to encourage citizens to walk and ride bicycles whenever possible. Besides, the government must encourage the commuters to utilize more affordable public transportations like buses and metro trains rather than using their cars. Finally and most importantly, the government need to increase the tax on car ownership while also improve public transportations so that many people are dissuaded from purchasing cars.\n\nTo recapitulate, concerned authorities should take strict measures to control car ownership in order to control the heavy traffic congestions and pollution.

I am in consummate discord with the proposal that bringing female leadership in place is a solution to control those disasters.In order to reinforce my view, a number of arguments could be presented. Firstly, a situation such as a war, dispute, and riot cannot be easily attributed to a gender of a leader. There are various agendas hidden behind such actions. For example, a country would engage in a war to retaliate its adversary. A tumult or riot could have engendered due to dissatisfaction or frustration of common public in the response to a governmental policy. The history has witnessed several male leaders who brought peace and freedom in the world, Mahatma Gandhi, Martin Luther King, and Nelson Mandela to name a few. History also has some examples where war was carried out under the leadership of female ruler.

This essay will discuss the benefits and drawbacks of such a measure.\n\nOne of the main beneficial developments of computers is that it made life easier and more convenient for everybody. For example, it is comfortable to sit at home and do research on the internet with your computer. Your computer is open 24 hours a day, unlike a library or office. In addition, computer technology can connect workers in different countries. Workers can communicate via email, online networks, and video conferencing. It gives people to save their time and money.

One of the main positives of getting an utterly different job is that it can change the person's lifestyle. For instance, after having worked for many years, some people are not so passionate about their careers anymore because they have become tired of the routine. Therefore, in this case, it would pay off to switch the job to the one that provides the person with a better work-life balance.

This essay expresses the ways older people can use technology and it also suggests some measures help older people overcome their lack of curiosity to take advantages of new technology.\n\nObviously, new technology alleviates the workload and help to complete our daily tasks instantaneously with high perfection and this does not exclude the old people. For instance, people can pay the utility bills, do online shopping or can complete bank transactions through Internet just sitting at home. Older people, if taught how to take advantages of it, can save time and perform their banking and other necessary tasks staying at home. Undeniably, most of the elderly people are weak and unable to travel a lot. So being able to pay the bills and maintaining the bank account at their residence would be a blessing for them. Moreover, the retired people are socially isolated and less often contact their friends or relatives due to their physical weakness. But using the Internet and mobile gadget they can chat, talk or make video calls and enjoy their old age.\n\nFurthermore, by the use of Internet they can also contact the family physician and discuss their illness and can do the follow-up. A simple video chat with a grandchild who stays far away or watching a favourite movie online could be a great satisfaction for a senior citizen. Once they are introduced with the advantages of the new technology like mobile phone, computer or the Internet, they will not fear the technological devices.\n\nNevertheless, interests towards learning new thing, especially technology related skills, decline as our age advances. This can be tackled by motivation and support from the youngsters. For instance, the grandchildren can teach the grandfather and grandmother how to operate a mobile phone or surf the Internet. In addition, mobile phones should be manufactured keeping those old people in mind. Large display with a larger font, voice navigation, and ease of use could be some vital factors to motivate old people to use cell phones. Instead of international language like English, local or regional languages should also be incorporated in the cell phone and websites so that the elderly people can follow the instruction independently. Last but not the least family members\u2019 inspiration and supports can be two great factors to encourage old people to take advantages of technological devices like cell phones and Internets. Old people do not need to know how to built a website, rather they should be taught how to browse a website and introducing them the positive and interesting aspects of the technology would also encourage them to actually use them.  \n\nIn conclusion, the advanced technologies like mobile phone and Internet could be really helpful for older people.

Every year the government has allocated a lot of money for the prevention and cure of the public most common diseases. It is agreed that spending public money to promote a healthy lifestyle for the prevention of illnesses is more importantly than for the treatment of already ill people. This argument will be proven that prevention is better than cure, and already ill people are expected to be at their terminal life.\n\nFor one, spending state funds on promoting a healthy lifestyle to prevent illnesses is better because prevention is better than cure. For instance, when I was working as an RHU (Rural Health Unit) nurse in a small community called San Pablo situated in the province of Pangasinan in the Philippines; we disseminated multivitamins and done vaccinations for children in the area because our government had a program called \"Eliminate Diseases by Prevention\", so we, as health officials and workers implemented it. It is actually a good campaign because no children in that particular community have had serious children diseases. Thus, they became healthier and the public money has been used wisely.\n\nIn addition to this, it is no sense using the people's money for those who are already ill because it is expected that they will be at their terminal life. For instance, in the ICU (Intensive Care Unit) of Urdaneta Sacred Heart Hospital where I am currently assigned to a hospital as a duty nurse, we have a terminally ill colon cancer patient, Mrs Corazon Cojuanco. When she is in her final stage and any further medications or treatments will not work in prolonging her life. So, cancer patients who are at their last stage, such as colon, lung or breast, should not be funded anymore because it is useless. It is really better to allocate the money for the promotion of healthy lifestyles.\n\nIn conclusion, spending more public money on a healthier lifestyle is better because prevention is always better than treating an already ill patient as well as it is no sense using it because they are already at their terminal stage of their life.

Some people consider that one can make the place for new things by throwing away the old ones. However, others believe that old is gold and one should repair them and reuse them. Several factors cause this phenomenon as well as their respective consequences.\n  The concept of throwing away older things has the negative effect on the environment. These things produce more garbage and eventually lead to the disposal problem. The more throwing away old things, more would be the accumulation of garbage. In a long run, this leads to the environmental pollution. Today, pollution has already become a serious threat to the world. Hence, it is suggested to repair the old things and use them instead of disposing of them right away.\n  On the other hand, what I believe is in three valuable R\u2019S- repair, recycle and reuse.

The non-biodegradable things such as plastic would go on collecting in the land and lead to the imbalance. Therefore, they should be recycled for the future use.\n  Nevertheless, one may counter argue that, if one re-uses the older things then what about the new ones, they just loose their market value and this may result in the production loss.\n  Finally, it is clear that this phenomenon receives the mixed response, it is the moot issue, and one has to take care this issue to avoid the major dreadful consequences.\n  [ Written by - Rahul ]\n ", "original_link": "https://www.ielts-mentor.com/writing-sample/writing-task-2/1650-ielts-writing-task-2-sample-600-people-always-throw-the-old-things-away-when-they-buy-new-things"}, {"essay_topic": "Nowadays more and more young people hold the important positions in the government.

They express their view on the fact that automation and technological advancements enable employees to do more works per hour and hence their office hours should be reduced. This essay delves into the issue and expresses my viewpoint.\n\nTo begin with, technological advancements and computerisation in an office greatly enhance the productivity of people. As a result, the staff can produce more output and can perform more efficiently. For example, in the pre-computer era, a bank cashier had to work manually, check different ledger books, verify a person\u2019s identity and then pay a customer. Moreover, at the end of the day, the cashier had to calculate all the transactions before he could leave the office alone with other cashiers. However, this is not longer the case with the automation in the banking industry. A cashier can now serve more than 3-5 customers in 15 minutes and at the end of the day, the banking software does the calculation. Hence, reducing the working hours seems quite logical to me.\n\nFurthermore, motivating employees and retaining the key employees are two challenges every organisation faces in this competitive age. Reducing the working hours could be an effective solution in achieving better success in the long run. Since most of the employees, these days, perform more tasks due to the technological help they should be given more time to spend with their family to establish a healthy professional and personal life balance.\n\nFinally, organisations which need to remain open 24/7 like the hospital, fire-service, hotel and so on should implement a rostering system and take advantages of the modern technology as much as possible to reduce the manual works. This would not only enhance their overall productivity but also establish a healthy and productive work environment.\n\nTo conclude, considering everything, I personally believe that the working hours of office employees should be reduced as it would both motivate staff and help organisations retain their better-performing employees and generate more output.", "original_link": "https://www.ielts-mentor.com/writing-sample/writing-task-2/1647-technology-and-automation-have-reduced-the-need-for-manual-labour"}, {"essay_topic": "Some people think the main benefit of international cooperation is in the protection of the environment, while others think that the main benefit is in the world business.

However, in many countries, the number of the younger population who are less than 15 years old has increased significantly and to a certain extent, this has a detrimental effect on the society, workforce and the country. This essay delves into the current and future effects of this trend in countries where younger generation predominates the bigger portion of their population.  \n\nWith regards to the current effect, an increasing competition in schools is obvious. Since younger generations are mostly school goers, parents would have to suffer to get their children admitted in a good school due to excessive competition. Many poor parents would be forced to send their children to work and earn and this will increase the child labour in many developing and underdeveloped countries. Finally, the disproportion of population age distribution in such countries will lead them to the scarcity of skilled labours and other professionals. Finally, since those children are not earning members, that would negatively affect the overall economy of the country. Increasing younger population, though are mainly thought to bring negative effects to the society and country, are not always a burden. They can support their community, become better members of the society through positive competition and can contribute to the family by sharing the workload.  \n\nConsidering the future effects of this trend, I believe that it would mostly depend on the economic factors and job facilities of a country. If the country has a great economic stability and can create plenty of job opportunities in the future, the under-aged population now would become the de facto to the economy in the future and that would enable the country to develop rapidly. The country will have a huge number of workers and professionals in the future and they would be able to increase the GDP of such a country. On the contrary, if the country fails to ensure jobs and business opportunity when those children will become adults, the outcome would be catastrophic. The unemployment and crime rate would surely increase and that would negatively affect the society.  \n\nTo conclude, although a right proportion of population age distribution is necessary, this is not the case in many countries.

The effect of this trend is so extraordinary and deep that it will someday challenge our own existence and implementation of effective measures  should be immediately taken.  \n\nConsumerism is a social and economic ideology that encourages people to acquire more products and services in an ever-increasing amount. Our materialistic lifestyle fuels this habit and we change our cell phones, cars and other household equipment more frequently than ever. Advertising plays a major role in creating a consumerist society and we are never contented with the things we have and want to acquire more than we need. Shopping is no longer a necessity and has turned out to be an activity for many. Thus we are producing an overwhelming amount of  wastages and a little effort has been in place to recycle many of our used items. The rapid advancement of technology often forces us to buy latest products as new products have better features than the one we own. The rise of the middle-income people globally and their desire to mimic rich people and adopt a technology centric lifestyle also the reasons for the increasing waste productions as a result of our throw-away lifestyle. Our traditional lifestyle and skills are almost gone and we want to buy everything rather than creating them. For instance, the number of people who rely on canned and packet food rather than cooking at home is a great example that shows the paradigm shift towards a busy and ready-made social lifestyle. Finally, the globalisation has immensely contributed towards our inclination to a throw-away society we are living in.\n\nThe problems that the throw-away society and consumerism tendency create are overwhelming. This is a degradation of human moral as a massive number of poor people are starving, on one hand, million tonnes of foods are being wasted in few countries on the other hand. The toxic waste and chemical garbage are polluting our environment while we are remaining busy to buy more electronic products. The global warming, temperature rise, extinction of many species are just the beginning and if we fail to take effective measures to stop this heinous trend, we will be destroying our future.  \n\nThere are many steps that should be immediately in place to address this issue. Non-recyclable packets, bags and goods should be restricted as much as possible. The environment friendly goods should be manufactured and used by people and elements like plastic bags should be totally banned. Every household wastes should be classified as recyclable and non-recyclable and recyclable waste should be used to produce new products rather than throwing them away. The government, as well as individuals' cumulative efforts to reduce the wastage production and to save the environment, should be in place.  \n\nTo conclude, no doubt our ignorance and desire to have more have contributed towards the creation of a throwaway society. Advancement of technology, globalisation, social and economic structure have all fueled this trend even faster.

The rapid development of the world and the ever-increasing competition are two reasons so many young students and professionals are looking for university education these days. The high cost of university education is still a reason many talented individuals cannot afford to get a higher degree and I strongly believe that it should be the government\u2019s responsibility to make the education free and bear the expenses of university education.First, the government has a huge budget for the development of education sector and the money could be better utilised by ensuring university education for talented individuals. The government already funds the public university education and taking full responsibility of the cost would ensure quality education for all. The difficult admission process in the university level filters out the talented students to take part in university education and they should be backed up by the government funds to let them concentrate on their studies. In order to encourage graduate students and professionals to further their education government should pay for their courses as it would bring more benefits in the future for the country. Many European countries have already implemented this method and they have a huge number of skilled professionals who not only serve the country but also the whole world.\n\nMore importantly, when citizens would be assured that the government will bear the cost of their children\u2019s university education, they would be more interested in preparing their children for the university degree rather than sending them to work and earn.

The consumption of oil, trees and fresh water is ever growing and though those resources are quite limited and non-renewable in many cases, we have taken very few steps to prevent the overuse of those invaluable resources. As a result, catastrophic outcomes are obvious and we should take every possible measure to solve these problems.First, reservation of oil and fresh water is not limitless and over consumption of these two resources will cause scarcity of natural resources. When the oil reservation will go down, nations will fight over it and factories, machines and cars will be useless without oil. Moreover, the overuse of oil causes uncontrollable air pollution and catastrophic effects like, the global warming and climate change which threaten our very existence on the earth. Fresh water is another big area of concern as it is a critical issue for the living organism and less than 3% water reservation on the earth is fresh water. Freshwater resources are depleting fast and this will cause our living on the earth impossible. Undoubtedly deforestation is the reason many species are becoming extinct and our environment is getting polluted. As most countries are trying to improve their economic conditions through industrialisation, we are imposing an unbearable burden to the natural ecosystem by consuming importation natural resources.

Many such countries have taken extensive initiatives to expand their tourism sector and many of them have gained enviable popularity. I believe that the reasons for developing countries to embark on this enterprise are many folds, and this is quite a positive development for them.\n\nFirst and foremost, popularity around the world is the reason many emerging countries are improving their tourism. They know that prevalence and exposure to the world are the keys to expanding their presence and dominance in the world. For instance, Malaysia is a well-known Asian country, and the expansion of its tourism sector has established its presence on the global map. Second, the tourism industry brings foreign money that can be used for the development of the country. For instance, developing countries like Thailand, China and Spain are earning huge foreign currency from their tourism industries. Third, tourism actually increases the business opportunities of a country and thus many countries are having a better trade relationship with developed countries only because the tourists of the western world came to visit such countries and thought about the business potentials. Finally, tourism creates job opportunities for local people and gives the host country an excellent opportunity to develop their infrastructure.\n\nI believe that, despite some negative effects, the tourism industry offers numerous benefits to a country. Among the negative effects, pollutions, influences of foreign culture and the threat of terrorism are often mentioned. However, in this era of globalisation countries cannot shut their doors to foreigners. So the tourism industry is rapidly enhancing and a country should take advantages of it. Earning foreign remittance, creating jobs for local people, introducing unique traditions, improving the transportation system, knowing cultural diversity are some of the quite astonishing advantages that development of tourism can offer.\n\nIn conclusion, the main reason developing countries are extending their tourism enterprises is that they understand the immense potential and benefits this industry offers and without any doubt, this is quite a positive development.\n ", "original_link": "https://www.ielts-mentor.com/writing-sample/writing-task-2/1636-many-developing-countries-are-currently-expanding-their-tourist-industries"}, {"essay_topic": "Team activities can teach more skills for life than those activities which are played alone.

While some may agree that isolated working or playing method is more beneficial, others, including myself, believe that group work can be more practical and can teach more life skills.\n  On the one hand, working without the participation of any partner has two major advantages. The first is that people can have their own authorization. Being more independent, they can make their own plans and handle their job themselves. As a prime example, a computer engineer can focus better on his tasks if he does not have any partner. To design a video programme, he can use the Internet and download the needed software without asking any assistance from any person. Furthermore, this method can be more profitable. Whereas in team working, the amount of money earned from product sales should be divided into several people, a single professional can save this money, and profits would not be shared among several partners.  While working alone people can focus more on the job and thus can achieve results faster. When a child plays alone, he gives more attention and thinks more than talking with others. Thus working alone could be better sometimes.  \n  On the other hand, despite the mentioned positive impacts of solitary works, in my view, team works can be the best option. One important reason behind it is that members would become more highly motivated. Clearly, by having more inspired individuals who have the same aim, each member will have a better feeling to finish the job. In particular, had not eBay, a prosperous international e-commerce trade which has surpassed other rivals since the last decade, worked in a group, it would not have become one of the most successful businesses in the 2000s. In addition, this method is less time-consuming. Obviously, each person has a specific ability to run the business; therefore, a problem can be addressed far simpler when it comes to the team working. For instance, although doctors may partially cover the nurses\u2019 or other healthcare employees\u2019 duties, they are not as skilful as they should be, and working as a healthcare team will be more beneficial to the patients. Woking in a team has many other advantages. Team members have different perspectives and thus solving a problem could be easier. Children, when play in a team, can learn from each other. They learn to share, communicate, solve problems as a team, lead others, help others compete in a positive way which is an essential quality for us. Thus team activities teach us far more practical skills of life than working or playing alone.   \n  In conclusion, in some cases, lonely working might be useful.

I believe, computers have revolutionised the education sector but a human teacher is still indispensable.\n\nSome subjects can be taught and explained better with the use of computer technology. Basic mathematics, language learning, programming and any area which requires a student to memorise basic facts through repetition are well suited to computer learning. The computer can be programmed to provide an endless number of simple questions, and as the student answers these questions, the facts are learned and reinforced. Moreover, distance learning could be an example where computer technology could be thought of as a blessing as it has made it quite intuitive and useful to learners.\n\nHowever, in the learning and practice of more complex ideas, the computer is not often adequate. A computer can evaluate an answer as right or wrong, but it cannot determine why. It cannot find out why a student is making mistakes and then represent important concepts differently so the student will understand. It cannot determine at what stage in a mathematics problem the student has made an error. Tasks involving reasoning cannot be taught by computers, as there are too many variables for a computer to deal with successfully. In these cases, a human teacher is indispensable in a classroom.

This trend has created some negative consequences and some people are worried that the problems are overwhelming which even outweigh the benefits this industry brings. I am however convinced that international tourism is definitely more beneficial in numerous ways which exceed the disadvantages it brings.\n\nTo being with, international tourism creates transcendent benefits on different levels. First and foremost, it provides individuals opportunities to see a different culture first-hand. According to my observation, visiting another country is a comprehensive experience, which is much more enjoyable than staring at another culture on a computer screen. Additionally, international tourism boosts the economy of the host country. Take Macau as an example. International tourism has produced numerous employment opportunities, as high as 66%, in various sectors of this country. Thirdly, knowledge gained during overseas trips certainly helps eliminate a range of stereotypes tourists have about the host country. In this way, individuals can expand their outlook and become worldlier.\n\nOf course, non-biodegradable litter left behind by tourists poses a big threat to the host country. Nonetheless, tourist destinations can certainly establish relevant laws and regulations so that this issue can be addressed. Once the economy of the host country has been enhanced by international tourism, it would be easier for the local government to implement effective strategies to solve this problem.\n\nTo conclude, even though international tourism may impede the environment of tourist destinations, the advantages of international tourism surely outweigh its disadvantages.Sample Answer 2:\nWith the advancement of the faster transportation system, especially air travel, people nowadays go to other countries for personal, business, recreational, official, health and educational purposes. The air travel is cheaper than the past and worldwide communication system, particularly Internet, has opened the doors of international tourism.

Clearly, the best source of information is news or some documentary programmes shown on television or the Internet; however, unfortunately, their coverage is not sufficient. In particular, billions of fishes died in Persian Gulf Sea during Iran-Iraq war from 1982 to 1989 due to oil spillage, while no organisation became responsible in giving enough data to people.

Some people claim that teachers are only an occupation to teach students about knowledge and academic information. Others advocate that teachers should teach not only subjects but also disciplines and basic ethical judgments. In my own perspective, the age of students is the truly crucial indicator to determine the aspect of teacher's role.\n\nIn kindergartens, children merely learn how to communicate with peers and how to be socialised. The purpose of teachers is aimed to assist children's socialisation and their personality development. In this stage, teaching academic subjects is not the first priority of teachers. Instead, teachers are more likely to build up a role model for students so that kids can establish adequately ethical perspectives, well-socialised behaviour and correct judgmental foundation.\n\nFrom primary schools to high schools, teachers, indeed, play a more complicated role in terms of teaching. Juveniles get easily influenced by external environment and other peers' behaviour. As a result, teachers are expected to guide those students in correct life pathway as well as to teach them a wage diversity of knowledge for future career and study life. Among this period, teaching and guiding students are equally important for teachers.\n\nAfter that, in university and higher education, most of the students are, comparing to previous stages, equivalently mature enough to take responsibility for their own behaviour. Therefore, there is no need for teachers and professors to teach those students how to judge right and wrong. Knowledge exchange is likely to be the major relation maker of the teachers and students at this stage.\n\nIn conclusion, undoubtedly, teachers take participant into student's life. The role of teachers does strongly associate with the age of students.\n  [ Written by - Kelly Chen ]\n  Model Answer 2:\nThere has recently been a debate regarding whether teachers are responsible or not for guiding the school learners what is correct and incorrect, while some people think that it is not included in teachers\u2019 working criteria. In my point of view, teachers should teach the students in order to help them to improve in every way possible.\n  Firstly, some people think that teachers are responsible for teaching what is correct and incorrect because it might assist the learner to identify what should they behave in the society. For example, if a child does not know anything when they are working in the society, it would not help them to solve the problem. They might just continue with the false concept. Possibly this will lead to a conclusion that everyone working in their own way. If this exists in Hong Kong, there will be a huge argument every day non-stop as people think that their own idea is correct, but actually not.\n  However, some people believe that teachers should only teach things that are related to the school syllabus. It is because they think that the parents will teach their own child at home. They will tell the kids what should they do and it is parents\u2019 responsibilities to guide their own child. Also, some parents think that teachers might teach bad things to their kids. For example, there are some teachers at the University of Hong Kong telling the students to occupy Central. This is extremely unacceptable. Due to this, parents only required the teachers to teach school-related stuff.\n  In my opinion, I agree with teachers only teaching school-based stuff would be a better option because for me personally, I do not listen to the teachers at all, I know that my parents will teach me how to behave and what I should do. For example, some teachers told me that I am doing something wrong, but still, I do not want to listen to them. As their words aren\u2019t influential at all, it won\u2019t make any impact on me.\n  To conclude, I think teachers should only focus on academic studies instead of teaching the learner about righteous and wrongness. Our parents will be responsible for that.\n  [ Written by - Lo Hannie ]\n  Model Answer 3:\nIt is often argued that teachers should be accountable for their student\u2019s good and bad conducts as they are responsible for teaching them the morality of their children. Others, on the other hand, opine that educators\u2019 role should be limited to imparting academic (educational) curriculum among students. This essay will discuss both points of view and argue that instructors can share the responsibility for inculcating socially acceptable manners in students along with academic course training, followed by a reasoned conclusion.\n  Many support the teacher\u2019s role in students\u2019 behaviour modification. Firstly they think that students spend much more time with their educators in school than with their parents. So it is easy for the trainers to develop a good interpersonal relationship with students and, thereby, can have a great influence on their trainees. In addition, they can give moral lessons through moral classes. Moreover, most of the students find their teachers as their role model. So the students accept the instructions of their professors\u2019 than anyone else.\n  Alternatively, others advocate that academic subjects must be the only priority for educators. They believe that this encourages teachers to concentrate only on course works and thereby could contribute to better academic achievements of the students. This is true in the case of pupils who follow the classes with great attentiveness. But this essay disagrees this view because it cannot bring maximum outcome from other students if they are not motivated to learn. So a teacher, who can impose good conduct in his students, who can divert his students from immoral behaviour, can expect the best possible result from his students.\n  In summary, although teachers\u2019 primary role is guiding students in academic course work, their ultimate goal should be creating citizen with good conduct and better career prospectus.\n  [ Written by - Liji Ajith ]\n ", "original_link": "https://www.ielts-mentor.com/writing-sample/writing-task-2/1620-ielts-writing-task-2-sample-570-teachers-should-be-responsible-for-teaching-students-to-judge"}, {"essay_topic": "As global trade increases between different countries, many daily necessities are produced in other countries.

In my personal opinion, the advantages of this trend far outweigh the disadvantages it has.First and foremost, global trade ensures the availability of a variety of products to the consumers.

To equalise these facilities among the citizens of a country, most of the people have the opinion that government should make regulations for compulsory rural service after the graduation by the professionals. Whereas others believe that it is an unethical interference with someone\u2019s freedom. This essay delves both these views before arriving at a logical conclusion.On one hand, mandatory service after graduation by health professionals and educational faculty are astonishingly beneficial to the rural people. For instance compulsory, one-three years rural service for new teachers, doctors, dentists etc. will alleviate the scarcity of trained professionals in the village area. In addition, those who have qualified from the government institutions receiving a grant from the government have their responsibility to serve the government and the people. Moreover, because of brain drain system community is getting very less service from the talented professionals and compulsory work in rural areas by new doctors and teachers will ensure that they concentrate more on serving people rather than planning to migrate to a rich country. Rural people have to move to city areas for better treatment and for their children\u2019s education and this has a negative consequence like overpopulation, increased crime rate and pollution in city areas. Adopting this strategy by the government will ensure a better distribution of the population in both rural and city areas. Finally professionals like doctors and teachers should focus primarily on serving people, not to amass fortunes. Unfortunately, teachers and doctors in many cases are far more concerned about money than helping people and few years\u2019 compulsory work in rural areas at the begging of someone\u2019s career would be a great leap toward appositive mind-setup by these professionals.\n\nOn the other hand, some others believe that in an independent country everybody should have the freedom to decide where to work and where to live. Any restriction and mandatory rules would violate their rights and would cause them to become frustrated. These professionals would then dislike to work or stay in their homeland and will try to migrate to a foreign country. Furthermore, this should be a spontaneous decision made by a newly became doctor and teacher and should not be a forced decision.  Hence the supporters of this view argue that compulsory work in rural areas is both unfair and harmful.\n\nPut everything into consideration, I personally feel that for a rapid and complete development of a nation both rural and city areas should get focus for facilities and development. The government should ensure the equal distribution of services and place new doctors and teachers in rural areas for few years would be a great idea to help rural people and also build a service oriented mentality among these young professionals.\n\n[Written by - Sukanya]", "original_link": "https://www.ielts-mentor.com/writing-sample/writing-task-2/1617-ielts-writing-task-2-sample-567-good-schools-and-medical-facilities-are-available-only-in-cities"}, {"essay_topic": "Modern lifestyle is completely different from the way people lived in the past.

In my city, there are a plethora of colleges but you need to burn the night oil to get into one of the top colleges in north campus.

Some people prefer to work in many places and gain life experiences while others argue that this is not always optimal. Is it really beneficial to be involved in many occupations or is it better to follow your dream path having only the favourite job? In this essay, both advantages and disadvantages of having many jobs will be reviewed and the author's opinion provided.I will start by analysing the advantages of changing career several times during the lifetime. One of the greatest benefits of having more than one job is that it is easier to earn money. Generally speaking, many students find an occupation so as to be able to become independent from their parents in terms of money. Although they find some trivial jobs, such as being a cleaner, they can become professional specialists after having finished their studies.\n\nAnother major positive aspect is that people are able to focus on their main job and additionally do something else after their work which might be more interesting. In my experience, I used to work as a software developer for an enterprise and read lectures at a university. It was beneficial due to fact that I earned enough money and it was exciting to share my knowledge with students.\n\nOn the other hand, there are some disadvantages too - one of them being the inability to concentrate on your career goals. For instance, it can be pretty difficult to devote yourself to the work that is the most important to you because either you may not prioritise your jobs or you lack time. Therefore, noteworthy is the fact that it becomes much harder to acquire the required experience.\n\nAnother significant drawback of having many jobs is that the life-work balance deteriorates. For example, for many, people feel inferior if they lack qualification in their new occupation. It is quite a frequent situation as it is tough to gain a wide variety of work experience.\n\nIn conclusion, the pros and cons of having and switching many jobs were described. In my view, the disadvantages outweigh disadvantages and it is suggested that people should work in many places only if they need money or only temporarily due to other causes.", "original_link": "https://www.ielts-mentor.com/writing-sample/writing-task-2/1604-ielts-writing-task-2-sample-554-these-days-people-work-in-more-than-one-job"}, {"essay_topic": "Nearly every new building is designed by an architect nowadays.

What could be the reasons for this? Is it a positive or negative development?", "extra_topic": "", "model_answer": "\nThe traditional belief that men are breadwinners while women should take care of chores and up bring children is no longer true in the modern era. In many places, this convention has gone to a reverse way and an increasing number of women work outside and men stay at home. There are several reasons for this and I personally think that it is a positive trend.\n\nWith the changes in social belief, more parents send their daughters for higher studies instead of preparing them for getting married and this enhances the capable and educated women workforce. In many fields, for example, telemarketing, teaching, fashion design, and banking, women are doing better than men and this has created a demand for female employees in the job market. The equal right movement has had a great impact on empowering women and this has become quite normal for mothers to work at offices while the fathers decide to stay at home to take care of their children. This decision is often based on mutual understanding of the couples and the one who has the higher earning potential decides to work to support the increasing expenses of the family. This has been socially accepted in most of the developed countries though some developing countries in Asia are yet to completely accept this trend.\n\nIn my opinion, this trend has more positive outcomes and should be treated as a progress. If both genders do not work for hand in hand and do not get the equal opportunity, the real progress would be impossible. This ensures that we live in an era when both men and women have an equal opportunity and someone is not deprived of a great career or a big opportunity only because of her gender. It is a great chance that allows the parents to decide who to earn money for the family and who to take care of the family, not based on social and traditional belief.\n\nIn conclusion, the changing roles in a family have been possible due to the great changes in social belief, advancement of women, especially in education and this is a very positive trend that eliminates the gender discrimination and advocates the equal rights.\n Sample Answer 2:\nWith the socio-economic development, breadwinner fathers and stay-at-home mothers are on a decline.

This essay will analyse reasons for this and its impact on the society.Family relations and moral values are the foundations of a reputable society. People opt to live independently because they want to live and lead a free life away from the family restrictions, regulations and norms. They say that their physiology doesn't match with other members of a family and living with them is a mental torture. For instance, children in Asian countries enjoy less freedom than that of West; once they grow up they develop the desire to live alone and autonomous life. Not all of it is associated with the family environment, few people working abroad prefers to live alone or with friends.

This essay will analyse the problem associated with extending the width of the roads and will suggest few alternatives.Proponents of this view point say that widening streets and expressways will help them to increase the number of lanes which in turn can cater more traffic. This strategy will surely help to reduce congestion, but usually, streets and highways are running at their maximum width and widening them either by narrowing the islands or reducing the pedestrian tracks would not be possible. In many cases, this strategy doesn't always work as the building and shops are already located at the edge of the road.

If you want to become an expert in a certain field, do you need to have more talent or more motivation?", "extra_topic": "", "model_answer": "\nWhile growing up, we've always heard tales about successful people; Ludwig Van Beethoven, Albert Einstein, William Shakespeare, and even president Lincoln. In regards of the virtues of a champion, I stand side-by-side with Muhammad Ali. I think that in order to be revered as an expert in your field, you need to set yourself apart from everyone else who are also trying to reach that goal. As Muhammad Ali put it, you need to be \u201ca little better\u201d- with more stamina, better speed, and a stronger will. Some people might have talent, but one thing that is imperative for a champion to have is motivation.\n\nPeople are more motivated to be successful in a field they like. When people have certain hobbies or jobs they like, they will not work on them out of obligation or with extraordinary goals in mind. They simply do those activities because they are entertaining or interesting; they are motivated. A friend of mine has an experience just like this one. Wilson has been obsessed with the piano since he was a child. Playing makes him happy and he wants to make a living out of it. Hence, he practices all the time- because he likes it anyway- and as a result, he was accepted to Juilliard on a merit scholarship.\n\nAnother reason why motivation is so important is because people do not decide to become experts on a whim. Determination and a strong purpose are required. People try, work, and think harder to achieve something when they have motives to do so. This applies to the newly-elected president of Indonesia, President Joko Widodo; having grown up as the son of a poor carpenter, President Joko Widodo- better known as Jokowi- wants to make a change. Therefore, his will to make Indonesia a better country caused him to delve into politics. In fact, he becomes the president who caters to the needs of citizens living in poverty.\n\nTo conclude, the one special that would make you different from everyone else is your motivation. When you are motivated, you will try, work, and think harder than others in order to achieve expertise in your field. After all, people with talent but no motivation will not succeed. They either choose not to pursue a career in the field or they are too lazy for their talent to be of use.

Fathers would go out to work and earn money to fulfil the families\u2019 daily needs and mothers would stay home to take care of the children. However, nowadays, it is not rare to find both parents going out to work. Whilst the additional income might bring benefits to everyone especially the children, there are a number of drawbacks that cannot be overlooked. This essay will confer whether or not it is necessary for both parents to go out to earn money for a living.\n\nIn some families, both parents are required to work not because of their own will, but because circumstances demand them to. As living cost and everything is getting more expensive in today\u2019s competitive world, some families might not earn enough to cover their living cost if only one parent goes out to work. That being the case, there is nothing anyone can do to help. However, the benefit of the extra income for the children still remains unchanged. With more income, parents will be able to afford more new toys, the latest gadget, and even vacation abroad.\n\nOn the other hand, children might feel abandoned due to their parents\u2019 never being there for them. It is also proven that children\u2019s, whose parents are never at home, are more prone to behavioural problems. For instance, my friend, Elaine, whose parents is always working overnight and is never there for her when she needs them, has to battle with her insecurity of being unwanted every day, she, in turn, tries to seek the attention of her teachers by behaving badly in the class. From my example, you can see how parents\u2019 absence can affect children in the long run.\n\nAs far as I am concerned, there is no need for both parents to be working unless it is really necessary. While additional income is benefiting for the children, the presence of a mother will be best for the children\u2019s well-being in the long run.\n\n( Written by - Jaclyn )  ", "original_link": "https://www.ielts-mentor.com/writing-sample/writing-task-2/1583-ielts-writing-task-2-sample-539-many-families-find-it-necessary-for-both-parents-go-out-to-work"}, {"essay_topic": "Some people believe that exams are an inappropriate way of measuring students\u2019 performance and should be replaced by continuous assessment.", "extra_topic": "", "model_answer": "\nExams have always been used as a way to measure students\u2019 ability and level of learning. However, I contend that it is not an appropriate way to determine one\u2019s performance and it should be substituted by a continuous assessment approach. The reasons for my contention are as follows.\n \nNowadays, cheating on exams is a commonplace. Therefore it is not uncommon for students who do not do well in the class to score high on the exams. Thus, when something like this occurs, there is no way for authorities to confirm whether or not the answers on the exams are really from the student and not the results of an unfair play. Teachers might forestall cheating from taking place, be it by strict invigilating or by the threat to fail the students who do not abide by the rules, there\u2019s still no way to ascertain that every student will comply with the rules. Hence the ineffectiveness of utilising exams as a way of measuring the ability of each student is quite clean.\n\nFurthermore, students have the tendency to memorise for exams without putting any effort in trying to thoroughly understand the materials taught. They will strive to obtain the highest score possible by this means. Memorising is surely a quick way to obtain a good score in a short time, however, it is not an effective way to study if one wants to deeply understand the materials. Consequently, exams are not appropriate when used to measure the ability of the students who memorise.\n\nIn conclusion, I believe that the best way to determine a student\u2019s ability is to continuously assess their performance in the classroom. By doing that, fair judgment of each student\u2019s ability will be ensured and students will also be fairly scored based on how well they do in the class.\n\n( Written by - Jaclyn ) ", "original_link": "https://www.ielts-mentor.com/writing-sample/writing-task-2/1582-ielts-writing-task-2-sample-538-exams-are-an-inappropriate-way-of-measuring-students-performance"}, {"essay_topic": "Because of the busy pace of modern life, many children spend most of their time indoors and have little exposure to the natural world.", "extra_topic": "How important is it for children to learn to understand and appreciate nature?", "model_answer": "\nIt is certainly true that the present time is less convenient for the children\u2019s outgrowth as they are over headed with enormous study materials by the school authorities.

There is a growing number of people who argue that drug abuse, in Indonesia, is considered as the biggest issue compared to the worldwide\u2019s cases because Indonesian government are not seriously taking some measures to tackle this problem. These people thought that by executing drug smugglers on death row measured as the best solution to reduce such case. From my point of view, I strongly disagree with this statement, and in further paragraphs, I will support my opinion by some examples.\n\nTo begin with, first and foremost, Indonesia is one of the largest multicultural countries and one of the biggest democratic countries all over the world. When Indonesian government officials decide everything related to policies, including drug smugglers, they have to consult with other stakeholders, namely practitioners, expertise, academicians, and societies as a whole. According to a new Indonesia president point of view, death row or death penalty, as well as Indonesian, called it, is not a proper solution to deal with this kind of problem mainly because it will lead to another problem. To implement this punishment is not as simple as it looks and there some implications.\n\nFurthermore, there are a variety of the possible solutions to cope with this issue. Firstly, the government should analyse the reasons behind drug smuggling that are conducted by both Indonesian and foreigners. Secondly, they have to implement strict rule both in airport and seaport, for instance, if officers on duty in both areas are not  doing their work properly, for example, suspected of bribery with drug smugglers, the government have to punish them with a brutal punishment. Lastly, Indonesian government coordinates with other countries how to deal with this view.\n\nTo sum up, whether or not drug smugglers should be punished by death row, from my view, death row is not the right answer into reducing drug smugglers in Indonesia.\n\n( Written by - Ach Maulidi ) ", "original_link": "https://www.ielts-mentor.com/writing-sample/writing-task-2/1580-ielts-writing-task-2-sample-536-drug-smugglers-should-be-punished-by-death-row"}, {"essay_topic": "Australia urges Indonesia not to execute drug smugglers on death row.", "extra_topic": "", "model_answer": "\nRecently the broadcasting about drugs has become the big issues which occurred in Indonesia.

They can be considered what Indonesian people want, but they must also notice about their relationship with other countries. It could not be ignored that they still achieve many kinds of foreign aid around the world, for instance, the familiar one is Australia Awards Scholarship (AAS) in term of educational support. Many Indonesian people had achieved their bachelor, masters, and even doctoral degree using Australia\u2019s funds.\n\nTo conclude, Indonesia government might think twice to decide whether the death penalty or others capital punishment for both Australian because it can be a risk for the future association with other countries in the world.\n\n( Written by - Denise Mambrasar )  ", "original_link": "https://www.ielts-mentor.com/writing-sample/writing-task-2/1579-ielts-writing-task-2-sample-535-australia-urges-indonesia-not-to-execute-drug-smugglers"}, {"essay_topic": "Nowadays many scientists and tourists would like to travel to remote natural environments, such as the South Pole.", "extra_topic": "", "model_answer": "\nSince ancient times, Planet earth is known to host a multitude of natural resources, scenic beauty, polar ice caps, mountain ranges, hidden terrains and so on.

This essay will analyse both views before presenting an opinion.On the one hand, people argue that they are free to do and act whatever they like. Proponents of this view point say that this is their fundamental right and make noise or live peacefully should be the sole preference of an individual. For instance, in sporting events, like football, the decibels are at their highest peak or celebrations like birthday parties at home where children shout on the top of their voice to make their presence felt.

When some recommend a fixed retirement age, which, according to them, is a win-win proposition both for employees and employers, others believe in early retirement facilities. I accord with the latter point of view.\n\nIt is undeniable that setting different retirement age for different professions is complex to manage for the government, and it would create discontent among many. That is why a state-wise fixed retirement age is in place in most countries in the world. It not only ensures fairness and equality but maintains the ratio of young and experienced workers' proportion in most sectors.\n\nHowever, forcing employees to work till a fixed age, like until 65 or 70, is an archaic method that has more demerits than merits. Moreover, letting employee retire early can create job opportunities for fresh-graduates, and this will have a positive impact on the unemployment issue. For instance, many Europeans leave their job before they turn to 60, and as a result, youngsters get job opportunities.\n\nFinally, when people are given free will to retire early, they work more enthusiastically and contribute more to the company they work for. They can also contribute to the local economy by setting up small businesses afterwards which also creates job vacancies. Some retirees travel the world and contribute to tourism industries. So I believe that professionals like architects, nurses, technicians, politicians, military personnel, journalists and teachers should be given choices to retire early. This way, they could enjoy their free time after a career filled with hard work, and can also contribute to the economy and tourism industry.\n\nIn conclusion, early retirement options can be beneficial in a tremendous way for the government, employers and employees. It could be a type of appreciation for the great effort of those workers who can fulfil their job objectives pretty accurately during their service years.

It helps in reducing stress, refreshes brain and help in maintaining the right balance in the body. Introducing children to music subject in their early ages is of great value. It not only develops love and affection for going schools but also improves their learning skills. For instance, rhymes and poetry can easily be memorised when sung in a chorus with background music.

New discoveries in life are only made by going out of daily routine to have new experiences. For example, Christopher Columbus only discovered the United States of America by going on a voyage to explore the world around him. Today, USA is considered one of the world\u2019s superpowers and has been a place for inventions and new discoveries.\n\nIndividuals who prefer to have same daily routine usually do not get the best out of life. For instance, scientists of neuropsychology have found a correlation between boredom and depression. Boredom has been found to be commoner in individuals that go through the same life experiences day in day out.

Some would regard it as beneficial; however, some are sceptical about it. In this essay, both views will be discussed.\n\nThere are those who do not agree with the death penalty for reasons such as police authorities could be mistaken \"the real culprit\" to \"a culprit\". In fact, there has been a situation before that the cops just wanted to prove that they have solved the case by picking up the one who they believed did the crime not knowing who actually did it. An example is the case of an Australian man named Mr. Johnson. He was prosecuted for committing murder and was hanged in the middle of the city-centre in Melbourne, but surprisingly, a week after his execution, a hesitant witness came out and pointed to the Victorian police who actually murdered the victim. This was a hot topic because of the public awareness, and this is the reason why such punishment is being disregarded.\n\nOn the other hand, there are various people who believe in it because it could give peace and order in the society. For instance, here in the Philippines, crimes such as rape, murder, homicide, robbery and many types of it are being committed as evidence in Philippine TV news. So, people strongly believe that capital punishment is needed to bring back the peace and harmony in the country. Way back, during the term of late President Ferdinand E. Marcos, the death penalty was strictly imposed, whether the sinner was wealthy and powerful or not. An example is the famous Chinese drug lord who was executed by the country's firing squad and televised it to the public. As a result, Filipinos were afraid to do crimes and the Philippine has even featured in New York Times magazine as one of the best countries to live in.\n\nIn conclusion, with regard to what I think, I believe that death penalty must be implemented.

The bases for my opinion are psychological and academic.\n\nFrom a psychological viewpoint, it is widely spread that students who do not receive sufficient attention at home are more prone to bad behavioural problem than those who do. As a result, they will use all means possible, namely behaving badly to obtain the much-needed attention from their teachers. Thus, grouping students with disruptive tendencies together is not the most appropriate solution as it will only make them feel more ostracised.\n\n\nFrom an academic point of view, putting disobedient students in one class will only limit their educational opportunities and further discourage the students. It will be hard for the teachers to educate the students when they are all disobedient and at the end of the day, nothing will get done.\n\nIt appears that combining the students, regardless of whether or not they're rebellious, will serve as a more effective solution.

Adults enjoy independence and power. For example, when a person is independent, he could be less answerable to the world. A person can even decide what kind of work he wants to do. However, as we know that power comes with greater responsibilities. Being an adult is not like walking in the garden. Adult's life becomes monotonous after some time. Work and responsibilities make this age stressful at some point of time. Even though, having so much money in the bank account, adults hardly spend quality time with friends.

Though in this age the world thinks you are immature to understand anything, this age does not bother about it. In this age everything looks challenging; for instance, convincing parents for an overnight outing with friends and saving pocket money to buy a favourite watch.

Why do you think is this happening? What can be done to encourage recycling among people?", "extra_topic": "", "model_answer": "\nIt is the 21st century. This is a modern epoch and in this epoch, there are many challenges being faced by the human. This is particularity true in the case of an increase in the waste material such as plastic, cans and paper create a hindrance in the whole world. Nowadays, many people are aware of recycling which help to curb this problem by reused the material. I will discuss, why this is happening, what we can do to resolve this issue and finally how people can be encouraged for recycling before drawing a logical conclusion.\n\nTo begin with, in my perspective, the first and foremost point about creeping the recycling is trash into cash. It means that waste products are sold by people for some cash, which helps to lead the recycling. For instance, in Japan, many people sell the waste product such as empty cans or useless plastic to workers, who collect the waste material for recycling.  Moreover, some people are aware of recycling, which helps to curb or tackle the problem, which is created by a non-biodegradable product such as plastic.\n\nSecondly, there are various ways to encourage the people about recycling such as awareness, which is an incredible way to encourage people. The government should spread the awareness about recycling to people by advertising.  They should show the advertisement on television, magazine and newspaper because the majority of people can easily notice the issue by such media. As evidence, in Canada, the advertisement about recycling is shown on television or newspaper by the government once in a year, which helps to increase awareness among people.\n\nTo sum up, after looking at above paragraphs, it is believed that the government should alert the people by advertising.( Written by - Sabby Multani) ", "original_link": "https://www.ielts-mentor.com/writing-sample/writing-task-2/1555-ielts-writing-task-2-sample-519-what-can-be-done-to-encourage-recycling-among-people"}, {"essay_topic": "Nowadays, the designs of the buildings in the community are affected by other cultures.

In this essay, I am going to examine both views and give my own perspective on the matter.\n\nOn one side of the argument, there are people, who argue that using old designs compared to new style considerably outweighs the disadvantages. They believe that this will maintain and preserve one's culture and would be necessary for promoting tourism. For instance, Vigan, one of the famous cities in the Philippines attracts a big number of tourists annually because of the beauty of their tourist spots which were patterned on old traditional Spanish houses in the Spanish era. As a result, there was a considerable increase in their income brought about by higher employment rate and income from goods and services.\n\nOn the contrary, others believe that modern style is better and have limited effect on one's culture. People have this opinion because they think that culture is vague and should not be dependent on just the cultural designs found in the society. They argue that culture is much deeper and its meaning should be rooted more in people's behaviour and beliefs. In addition, many point out that culture should not hinder development and innovations on architecture. They strongly argue that architecture should be expressed freely and should not be confined on tradition.\n\nIn my own opinion, both arguments have their own merits.

Drift in the environmental system is largely due to global warming which has become an acute problem. This essay will analyse the root causes of global warming and will suggest remedies to lower the risk associated with this alarming problem.There are many causes of global warming, but it is mostly due to the greenhouse effect. The greenhouse effect is a phenomenon where gases such as carbon dioxide trap heat from the sun which causes the global temperature to rise above optimal level. Activities of human beings contribute equally to the increase of global warming. Factories and vehicles result in the emission of carbon gases and fumes which are depleting the ozone layer surrounding the earth. Utilisation of fossil fuels and other hazardous chemicals are other reasons of global warming. Moreover, countries are becoming more industrialised and are dumping waste into the atmosphere without realising its harmful effects and severity of the issue.

For instance, we wash our clothes using a washing machine, we cook foods using a stove or a microwave oven, we travel using cars or aeroplanes, and we even build houses using machines and modern tools. From simple to complex tasks, we are dependent on technology. Hence, some will agree that technology makes our lives a lot easier and comfortable. However, despite the benefits that it brings, I believe that this development is less beneficial to human society especially on how it affects human productivity in terms of work. This argument is supported by stating the ill- effects of technology to society.\n\nFirst and foremost, the emergence of technology creates a negative effect on human skills enhancement. For example, the majority of the students prefers to use the internet in doing scientific research and solving mathematical equations instead of utilising their critical thinking skills. This impedes self-development and growth through lack of practice.\n\nSecondly, people tend to become more and more dependent on technology to the point that some would fail to complete tasks without the assistance of computer and machines. This can be illustrated by the incidence that occurred last year here in Manila. Many companies failed to meet their desired quota because machines do not work without electricity. Workers are not well trained and cannot meet production without the assistance of computers and machines.\n\nMoreover, due to technology, there are fewer job opportunities for vast workers. This happens because most of the business men invest on machines than hiring workers. They believe that machines are cheaper than paying skilled and trained workers it is resulting in a high rate of unemployed.\n\nLastly, technology affects people's connection and passion in doing their job. For instance, in the past, clothes are woven manually by women, now they use the sewing machine instead. With the use of these machines, they lost their personal touch to the clothes that they have created.\n\nIn summary, the drawbacks of modern technology further outweigh its benefits.

This is one of the major causes for the climate change problem the world is facing today. To address this issue, it is better for the governments to build a reliable and convenient public transportation infrastructure instead of spending money on the development of pollutionless cars. Bases for my views this solution is economical and social.\n\nFrom the economical perspective, public transportation systems are cheaper choices for the people and affordable for all classes of the society. For instance, the MRT system in Singapore helps millions of people to travel daily with comfort and convenience. In addition, it generates revenue for the government as it requires one-time capital investment to set up a mass transportation system like a metro train system and to get a recurring income thereafter. In addition, such a transport system helps the public to save money in travelling and reducing their cost of living.\n\nFrom the social perspective, public transport system helps the society in many ways. Less traffic on road means fewer accidents, and thus creates a safety living environment. Moreover, the roads are freely available for critical life-saving services like fire accidents, medical emergency and police operations. Also, a public transport system helps to unite all classes of people in the society by providing a uniform means of commuting.  On the other hand, the private vehicles, which are of different quality and cost for the rich, average and the poor, displays the economic gap within the public in society.\n\nIn conclusion, even though pollutionless cars are good for the environment, a good public transport system is a better choice for its residents because it is not only environment-friendly but also accessible for all in the community.

On the contrary other groups of people find it hard to accept that it is a natural trend and criticise the rich nations for the brain drain. I believe that rich countries to some extent allure talented individuals to settle there but mostly it is decided by individuals and it is a natural movement by talented people.To begin with, the life standard, security, career growth, political environment, research facilities and many other aspects of a better life in rich countries are far better than the poor nations. That is why capable individuals who might contribute to a great extent for a country are often allured by the rich nations to move and work there. The brain drain system that mainly attracts talented professionals to settle in rich nations could not be denied. According to a recent statistics, more than 10 percent talented individuals from Asian countries are permanently living and working in countries like the USA, the UK, Australia, Canada and Sweden. Rich nations have many large and world known organisations that hunt for the talented people who are in IT, engineering, medicine or in other similar professions from poor nations and encourage them to contribute for their countries. Because of this talent hunt or more specifically brain drain system many poor nations are suffering from the scarcity of talented professionals.

Unfortunately, this will make it harder for schools to educate students as problematic behaviours are likely to interfere with the education process.\n\nThere are some reasons as to why students behave inappropriately. Firstly, the way society works these days affect students\u2019 behavioural patterns. For instance, parents might spend more time at work than at home and as a result, children lack parental guidance, not knowing how they are supposed to behave. This, in turn, is likely to cause them to have behavioural problems. Secondly, such behaviours might be caused by external influences, such as internet and television. Students, for example, might watch TV shows that use a lot of violence. Therefore, they are likely to imitate in real life by being more aggressive and using more violence. After all, students, especially teenagers, are easily affected by external parties.\n\nIn order to counter such problem, teachers should be friendly while still maintaining their professionalism. By being friendly, teachers might be able to understand students\u2019 point of views and thus devise the right strategies to connect with them. This is because students are more likely to listen to teachers if they feel they can relate to the teachers and that the teachers understand them. Furthermore, it is also important to handle students patiently. This is really crucial since rough treatments might worsen their behaviours or encourage them to play truant. It is, therefore, wiser to be patient and guide students gradually to be well-behaved rather than using force to do so.\n\nIn conclusion, behavioural problems result from the way society works these days (e.g. lack of parental guidance) and external parties, such as bad influences from TV shows.

Clearly, people will not need to learn new things as they are already more cognizant about the activities that they habitually perform.

As can be expected, the progress and success in life are often achieved when a person tries to explore new ideas and practices, which might be beneficial for the improvement of his or her life.

Why is this the case? What are the benefits of travelling for the traveller?", "extra_topic": "Idea Generation for this IELTS Essay:", "model_answer": "\nGone are the days when people used to spend all their lives in the same city and the tour was a word for rich people only. Now, with the technological advancements, cheaper flight, and ever increasing awareness towards other states and countries, the world has become a smaller place. Having travelled since childhood, I can definitely say that the tourism industry is changing fast and this is attracting a lot more travellers each year. This essay delves into the reasons behind increasing travellers and benefits of travelling.  \n \nFirstly, people want to get refreshed quite often due to their increasing workload and they have easy access to information they want. These are the two main reasons people travel more frequently than ever before. It is evident that busier workdays and the hectic lifestyle can easily drain one out. People have started to work more and earn more as compared to earlier days. Also, with the wave of information that the internet has brought, everyone is better informed about the world outside their office or home. These things have acted as precursors to the increase in the number of people who opt travelling as a holiday get away.   \n \nSecond, tourism is taken very seriously in several countries now. Countries like Australia and France have travel & tourism as an important part of their economy. Tourism contributes to around  30%  of the national GDP for Dubai. Thus, people have started picking up careers in the realm of tourism, as travel bloggers, trip organisers, etc. I myself have met people who travel for a living and love doing so. These factors have also led to accrual in the travelling population.  \n \nI believe travelling exposes us to different people and their traditions, outside or even within a country. India itself is a collection of myriad customs, flavours and languages. Visiting places one has never been to and meeting people with different beliefs broadens our perspectives. Introduction to different cultures catalyses respect towards the mutual differences. It helps us understand people in a new light, which can be very helpful to alleviate tensions during political or cultural conflicts.  \n \nIn a nutshell, I would say that travelling is equivalent to education. It can bring people closer to each other despite their differences, which is very important in today\u2019s global world.

Firstly, a lot of people prefer to consume in fast food outlets nowadays. It is undeniable that most of the fast food restaurants serve foods that contain fat and sugar, and as a result, those who frequently consume the food get overweight. Secondly, it is a fact business competition is getting tougher due to the globalisation, and people have to work for longer hours.

It can be seen that during international tournaments, athletes from various nations are competing against each other in a sportive way.

It is believed that the disappearance was due to the globalisation and the westernisation of the European and American, which have forced people to communicate in International languages such as English, German or French. Other people have an opinion that the extinction of the languages is not a serious threat to the world since most of them that die out are minority languages which are spoken by several people.

Many young people want to become independent and prefer their own source of income rather than relying on parents or guardian to meet their living expenses. They believe that learning skills while at work is far better than attending a college.

Do you think that being a celebrity brings more benefits or more problems?", "extra_topic": "", "model_answer": "\nA celebrity works hard to get the attention of the public and once s/he becomes famous, s/he constantly tries to avoid the attention. Being a celebrity is certainly not a piece of cake. They get all the attention of the world at the price of personal space. It is a debatable topic whether being a famous personality is a blessing or a punishment.\n\nFirstly, let us look at the negative side of being a celebrity. As the majority of the world follows the film starts or the sports persons, few of them are crazy about the celebrity. For instance, in the headlines of few newspapers, we keep reading about the fans who write a letter by their blood. I am certain that no one would like to receive such letters, constant annoying calls or being stalked by strangers. These all scary things come with the tag celebrity. Moreover being a celebrity is not an easy job. The film starts and sportsman has to continuously perform well otherwise same fans would harm them. For example, when the Indian cricket team did not perform well in one of the matches, their fans broke the cricketers\u2019 houses.\n\n\nThere are always two sides of the coin. Everybody wants to be a special person. Many people dream to become a celebrity so I am confident that the celebrity status must be giving a lot of advantages. One of the biggest benefits is the money. Celebrities make a lot of money compared to other people. It is known that a supermodel earns more than a school teacher. Moreover, anyone can become a celebrity. For instance, no academic degree is required to become a film star or a sportsperson. Sometimes, the film stars get a chance to shoot in foreign countries or play in different locations. So it\u2019s a great combination of holidays and work. The kind of glamour and publicity received by them is hard to imagine for a common man.\n\n\nI believe that being the role model for someone is the biggest achievement of a human life and being a celebrity gives a chance to be one.Sample Answer 2:\nAlmost everything has two sides \u2013 positive and negative; being a celebrity is not different.

The future of print media in the digital era is a debatable issue. Though some people hold the opinion that the popularity of printed newspaper will exist in the forthcoming days, my two cents is this print news portal will soon disappear to make way for the digital way of getting news.\n\nOne obvious reason for my viewpoint is that online portals and e-newspapers are gaining vast acceptance by its sophisticated features such as clarity, video sharing, social sharing and instant opinion sharing tools. Over and above, public goes by online news portals than print versions in order to get instant and breaking news. The vast popularity of online editions of the newspapers is the best epitome. When an Internet user can browse virtually any newspaper in the world for free, why should he spend money on reading only a particular newspaper which does not have last hour breaking news?\n\nSome would argue that there is a different appeal to holding a printed newspaper than reading on the computer screen. That\u2019s true, but they should compare the old way of sending letters to the latest email technology. The number of emails people send on an average is million times higher than the traditional postal mails and in a similar fashion, reading a newspaper would become a tradition of the past while online news portals would dominate the world.\n\nTo draw the conclusion, the newspaper will soon get its place in history.

The public is always keen about health policies of authorities. Some people hold the opinion that the investing money for health awareness bear better fruit, while others argue that the construction of good hospital bring more beneficial aspects to the public. This essay discusses both the view and adds my own opinion.\n\nSome people believe that the money spent on health awareness brings about the prevention and control of several ailments. They point to the fact that the massive changes come about by the appropriate health awareness programs. If citizens become well informed and proactive in health-related matters, we do not need to go the extra mile to prevent the break out of many communicable diseases and epidemic in societies. Over and above, many lifestyle diseases can be prevented as easy as pie by proper health awareness to the public.\n\nSome others believe that the spending money to build hospitals and health care centres pay more dividend. They argue that the well equipped and facilitated hospitals are inevitable to treat many serious ailments such as cancer and cardiac problems. In addition, improvements of some genetic diseases such as Down syndrome and Haemophilia call for better hospital care. Apart from that, the accidents and trauma care are practicable only in good health institutional settings.\n\nIn short, health awareness plays a pivotal role in good health policy. Many lifestyle diseases can be preventable by this attempt.  In my opinion, well-equipped hospitals play the significant role in people's health. In the hustle and bustle lifestyle, the accidents and communication diseases are not uncommon. At this juncture, advanced treatment facilities are the necessary part of society.

Are there any alternatives to animal experimentation?", "extra_topic": "", "model_answer": "\nMedical science has improved tremendously over last few decades. The majority of the medicines available in the market have been tested on the animals and once the satisfactory results have been received, those medicines are approved for human use. Many people question these days is it required to torture animals in the name of medical needs.\n\nExperimenting on the animals for scientific purposes has been adopted since many years so certainly there must be few advantages of it. Firstly, human life is very important so it would not be a wise step to try medicines directly on humans. Experimenting on animals is a proved technique. Our science has discovered that the human body is similar to the animals. For example, the anaesthesia, which is used to make animals unconscious, works similarly on the humans.\n\nOn the other hand, it is definitely inhumane to treat animals as a machine. Animals are tortured during the experiments. For instance, to test the nail polish, the chemical is put into rabbit's eyes. Because animals cannot speak, we are unable to understand their pain. In few of the experiments, the animal's body parts are being cut one by one to capture the record the medicine's effect.\n\nScience has progressed in all the directions. So, we surely have few alternatives which should be encouraged to alternate animal experimentation. One of them is to use more natural products. If the demand for the chemical product is reduced, such experiments would definitely be reduced. For instance, many cosmetic companies are selling natural beauty products, where it is clearly mentioned that \"Not tried on animals\". If people increase the use of such products, other cosmetic companies would also try to sell natural products. If we can develop medicines to reduce human pain, we should also create medicines to reduce animal\u2019s pain during experiments.\n\nI believe that we all have equal rights to live happy and healthy lives on this planet.

All kinds of banking establishments have to make certain policies to avoid misunderstandings with customers and lessen uncomfortable situations related to using credit cards and loans.

Albeit, the internet has several drawbacks, I disagree that it outweighs the advantages.\n         \nIt is true that the internet can bring some negative influences toward human behaviour, such as consumerism and autistic manner, to name a few. Consumerism, for example, is caused by the rapid growth of e-commerce, online advertising, and internet accessibility. Because of these, people found it easy to do transactions. They prefer to buy things online other than making an effort to go to their nearest local retail shop. On the other hand, such conditions, especially internet accessibility, which compounded by widespread usage of mobile gadgets, had induced autistic manner among internet user. Autistic here, means, that people tend to be less active and isolated at the same time because they can easily do things with the internet by only having gadgets in their hand or sitting in front of the computer.\n\nHowever, information technology has also done justice to mankind. Firstly, it helped brings people together despite country boundary and remoteness. Secondly, due to the internet, people can bridge the gap of communication's distance easily and rapidly.

As far as I am concerned, I think the dress code is important and should be followed especially in schools and offices. The way person dresses up gives a lot of indications about their attitude and personality and therefore can sometimes make or break you.\n\nFirstly, having a dress code gives you the feeling of unity and togetherness. Many times having a dress code could make people forget their differences and work towards a common goal. For example, all the sports team and government organisations such as police and armed forces have same dress or uniform, which instils the feeling to being part of the team and working for a common goal. Many schools have dress codes, which is very vital to make the student understand that the in spite of differences in their cultural and financial background, they are equals and will only be evaluated based on merit.\n\nDress codes are also important in offices, especially in customer facing roles. When a person interacts with the clients, he or she is representing the company and dressing appropriately is essential. Different companies have different styles of work which represented by their dress code. For instance, a financial institution generally has a formal dress code, since it gives the impression of being attentive and serious towards their work. Suppose if a person dresses in torn jeans with loose fitted T-shirt and loafers, I am sure clients would not be comfortable giving their money to such hands. Similarly, if you work in fashion industry, you are expected to be funky and experimental and not wear formal clothes. So, it is important to dress according to the profession you are in.\n\nIn a nutshell, the \u201cfirst impression is the last impression\u201d and therefore, it is crucial that dress code is carefully chosen and followed.Sample Answer 2:\nThere is no denying the fact that dressing plays a vital role in one\u2019s physical appearance. To choose a proper dress is something of a dilemma to the public because they sometimes are confused.

Some people think that the public libraries should offer the unlimited access to software, videos and DVDs; while others hold that it is only a waste of money. I tend to agree that public libraries need to be equipped with special high-tech media devices.Sample Answer 2:\nIt is a fact that public libraries are present in almost all cities across the globe, due to its emerging needs. In addition to let reading and selling books, most of the libraries have digital media like software, videos and DVDs. I refute that on top of providing books, libraries should not the rovide latest media to the users. This can be proven by analysing how libraries can attract youths as well as have an advanced effect, by having the option of lending latest technological media.\n\nFirstly, by providing latest media in libraries, a lot of youngsters will be interested in coming to the library, as they are very comfortable with using the latest technology. For example, consider the software which helps in learning a language. For the young people who are comfortable in using computers can learn the language within very less time, as the software acts as a very good guide. If the same task has to be accomplished by a book, people would find it very difficult as there is no feedback. Thus, it is obvious that by lending latest technology in libraries, can be advantageous.\n\nSecondly, high technological media can give advance effect as it can be played on the appropriate gadget. For instance, a DVD player has an option to stream the video and it can have the appropriate sound effect. Moreover, it has an option to start, stop and move forward or backwards at any time. Books cannot have any additional effect. Hence, it is clear why lending latest technological media in the library is worth.\nThe present era is the blessing of technology and these technological advancements should be embraced as many ways as possible. We are not talking about replacing books by using technological advancement, rather we are talking about adding the benefits that the technology can offer in a library where more people would come and get better facility and learning environment. Hence, spending money for technological benefits in a library is never a waste of money.\n\nBy analysing how lending latest technological media in libraries can help more youngsters attracted as well as can have special effects, it is considered that libraries must provide updated media.

The current economic condition of the contemporary society requires parents to spend more time at work.

A good illustration for this is the recent innovation of the \u2018Whatsapp\u2019 which provides an alternative for sending messages free of charge. Although this innovation has eased the means of communication it is nowhere compared to the face-to-face communication and it lacks the feeling of closeness. Thus, the link between improved technology and degraded communication skills can be seen.\n\nIn addition, advancement in technology has resulted in replacing people with the machines at various workplaces.

There are various reasons for it. Firstly, everybody wants to be financially independent. Secondly, with the increasing inflation and cost of living, it sometimes becomes necessary for both the partners to work. But there is no gainsaying in the fact that this impacts family life and children.\n\nWhen both the partners are working, it becomes difficult to spend time together and with the family, especially when the work timings are different. Children suffer the most in this situation. Mostly when children are merely one year old, they are sent to day care centre and are taken care by strangers. Childhood is a very crucial time in everybody's life.  This is the time when children learn most, they pick up good or bad habits, develop emotional bonds with their parents. But when both the parents are working, children spends most of the time away from their parents and hence the emotional connect is not as strong as it should be. Even when all family members meet in the evening, both parents would be tired of all day work and could not spend quality time with each other.\n\nOne major drawback of the both parents working is there is nobody to constantly keep an eye on children and to correct them instantly. For example; when I was growing up, my mother was always at home when I came back from school, and I would spend hours telling her what happened in school. She would feed me wholesome food and then help me with my homework. As I was growing up, she taught me, how to cook, do the dishes, and clean the house. Whenever I was late for home, I was answerable to her. Whenever I committed any mistake, she could catch it instantly and would correct me. Her constant support helped me, not only in achieving good grade but also to be a better human being; whereas my friends whose both parents were working, would come to an empty house, they would mostly survive on snacks after school. Their grades constantly suffered because they would watch TV or loiter around during study hours. They would often lie to their parents and would escape uncaught.\n\nOther problem that impacts the family life when both partners work is \"ego\". Since both are independent, ego often comes between both the partners; there would be a lot of argument. The increase in divorce rate is also due to this decrease in tolerance level.\n\nIn nutshell, it is sometimes important for both the parents to work but this certainly has an impact on children and the family life.

Although the competitive environment is the need of modern era, it is jeopardising the personal life of individuals in many cases.\n\nHealthy competition is present in every walk of life.

Since childhood we have grown up with many don'ts and do's which directly and indirectly taught us many lessons of life and made our life easy, comfortable and successful.\n\nAs a rule, parents define timetables of all the activities to be done in a day which is called good habits like getting up early morning, staying clean, having food in time, respecting elders, loving youngers, not to trouble anyone and so on. If a child follows these rules would greatly benefit in future life like having a healthy life, being amiable and punctual, caring others etc. The rule means a protection shield from possible harms. Out of their experience of their life, our elders ask us to follow the rules and stop us if we are going towards the wrong path.\n\nMoreover, these rules and punctuality would protect us from so many bad habits and keep us alert to choose right friends, become a good citizen and being able to take responsibilities.\n\nIn another way, if the children who are always under control and pressure of their parent's strict rules they face another challenge of life. For example, those children will be less confident, poor in decision-making skills and would not be able to lead others. They take the time to mingle with society and hesitate to interact with anyone. They look for their elders always to show them the path and lead them. As a result, they would not be able to face the real world and other people can take advantages of that because they do not have the sensibility to distinguish between right and wrong sometimes.\n\nHence I agree there should be certain rules to make children learn good things but we should not crush their emotions and feelings. It's parents and teachers\u2019 responsibility to teach them why they have to follow the rules and how few things are not good for them.

A group of people think that rather than following the development of technology, we should have a simpler way of life.

Many inventions are beneficial for human beings, but they have a catastrophic effect on the environment. For example, the invention of cars that use fossil fuel has caused some serious effect on the world. The cars produce carbon monoxide which is not only dangerous for living creatures, but it also becomes the main cause of global warming.

Another reason is the occupation. Sadly, the number of jobless individuals has fundamentally increased globally. The economy recession occurred in 2008, caused the number of jobless people raised far significantly.

For instance, in Indian culture, it was very common for young people to always respect the elderly people but nowadays this behaviour has almost vanished. Globalisation, the influence of foreign cultures and sense of individuality are some main reasons for this paradigm shift. The cultural exchange between the nations are rapid and that gives the young generation a sense that they are not obliged to respect others. The impact of western culture has destroyed the traditions in many countries and this is another reason for the less polite behaviour among the youth. Secondly, with the advancement of technology people are busy with the social media, foreign music and movies. For example, the younger generation is not only engaged with their mobile gadgets but also spend less time socialising and as a result, they have less time for others.

I believe that if they undertake responsibilities, only then healthy tourism can be provided.\n\nFirstly, every country has its own culture which attracts tourism and tourists want to experience their cultural values and norms. So, if they deny being responsible enough to follow them, there is no use of travel to such countries. For instance, Golden Temple in Punjab (India) is a very popular religious place where every devotee has to cover their head and pay respect. In case tourists would not follow the rules, they will not be welcomed by temple devotees and local community.\n\nSecondly, In the case of the environment, it is extremely important for tourists to be aware of every place where the intending to travel. Every attraction has its rules to follow to keep tourists safe as some beaches have deep water level, some have shark endanger areas and so on. They should not be making beaches and harbours filthy. Recently, at Wellington Harbour, the council has to spend half a million to remove debris which could cause danger to sea creatures and natural beauty of the city. If the country has to face heavy expense to retain its natural beauty then it would not provide healthy tourism.\n\nFinally, I would like to say that tourists should do research about the country they are planning to visit before they travel to have an enjoyable experience for both sides which will promote good relations among tourists and countries.\n\nIn conclusion, host countries always try to give the best experience to the visiting tourists as this is a major source of earning for many countries.

Some people believe main aim of having zoos in the cities is the amusement of the people. However, I do not agree with this outlook and believe zoos also serve other purposes.

For instance, getting knowledge about anything can become much easier when kids actually see them. In other words, zoo keeper talks organised at zoos provides very useful information on these animals and thereby, students can learn to respect all the living creatures. Therefore, it is evident that educating school pupils is the one important purpose of these zoos.\n\nAnother crucial need of zoos is protecting endangered species. A good illustration for this is that these species can be saved from being killed by the hunters and also scientist can work on improving the population of these species by arranging artificial breeding programs. Thus, the future generation will also be able to experience these animals and the issue of extinction of animals can be solved. From above, the theory of having zoos for conserving wildlife is difficult to debunk.\n\nIn conclusion, it is seen that the zoos not only play a key role in the education of folks but also help to guard animals against hunting.

In our day-to-day mundane routine, it is movies, music and sports that rescue us from the boredom and monotony. They inspire us, motivate us and it makes us hope for better by giving a vivid experience which is often larger than life, through films, songs, concerts and games.

Also, we will discuss how designing user-friendly applications and phones can encourage such people to use them.\n\nTo begin with, old people sometimes find difficult to travel a long distance. In this case, cell phones and internet can come to their aid by helping them to communicate with others without commuting. In addition, they can use these technologies for ordering the food or reserving their tickets and thereby, will avoid standing in long queues. Thus, it is evident that these people can take benefit of these facilities for staying in touch with relatives or family and even satisfy their daily needs.\n\nIn order to motivate these people for using such facilities, companies should concentrate on developing easy to use web applications or the phones. For instance, they can develop cell phone with the big keypad and the internet apps which provide information in their local language. In this way, old people will be able to understand how to use them and hence, can enjoy their use. Therefore, focusing on the development of products which can be easily understood will encourage such people to use them in their daily life.\n\nIn conclusion, the communication will be easier for the aged people with the use of this technology. For achieving this, organisations should make an attempt to develop products which can be handled by old generation. It is thus hoped that government will make some efforts in forcing industries to produce such products.[ by - Aqeela]", "original_link": "https://www.ielts-mentor.com/writing-sample/writing-task-2/1427-ielts-writing-task-2-sample-421-mobile-phones-and-the-internet-are-very-useful"}, {"essay_topic": "More and more people today are using computers and electronic devices to access information.

In modern scenario, with the passage of time and advancement in technology use of electronic gadgets is increasing rapidly in order to access information. Despite this, it is agreed that in the foreseeable future print media will disappear and computer, mobile phones will be used by masses because computer provides fast, convenient service as well as accurate information.\n\nFirstly, accessing information online provides us comfort as masses can use it at anyplace and anytime within few seconds. For instance, today with the help of search engine like Google, Bing and so on accessing information has become more convenient than the past. Individuals just need to enter a keyword in search box about one particular object and whole the information will be in the front of their eyes within seconds like if anybody enters Apple iPhon Google search box then whole the detail of establishing apple company and products will be on their smartphone screen. Thus, this makes it clear that print media is not going to be operational anytime in the near future.\n\nSecondly, on print media getting latest information is slow rather than electronic devices. For example, a few months ago when Malaysian airplane was crashed then information about it was available on the same day on the internet as well as television but on print media, it was available after one day. Moreover, on Wikipedia individual can get information about past centuries and about every celebrity, which is tough to find in print media and showing information by Wikipedia is accurate and really tough to deny.\n\nIn summary, electronic gadget helps masses to keep updated with the latest invention.

To what extent do you agree to that?", "extra_topic": "How do you think children should spend their free time?", "model_answer": "\nMany people think that modern children have an abundance of free time and doing more school work in their free time is necessary. As parents, being concerned about children's grades and studies is natural but overpressuring them to study and get top grades might backfire. Children's leisure activity should be fun yet interesting which will eventually teach them important lessons and make them more creative.  \n\nSchoolwork is definitely important. But if children are forced to study all day long without having enough time for recreation or refreshment, it will increase their stress level and negatively affect their physical and cognitive development in later stages of their lives. I believe, free time means a child should be allowed to do things that our of their normal routine.\n\nFor children, it can be playing sports in the playground or a park with other kids of their age. This will teach them how to be a team player and enhance their social skills. They can also play educative video games for a few minutes and watch cartoon shows. Besides, practising a hobby sounds impressive to me. For this, a family should be open-minded and try to find the hidden talents of their offsprings. I believe that not all children are born with particular talents. It is our duty as parents, teachers and relatives who motivate them and engaging them in extracurricular activities such as drawing, dancing, singing etc are also necessary. We have to understand that an unsocial adolescent with good academic grades cannot make much impact on our society and cannot climb the professional success.\n\nIn conclusion, even though studying and preparing for exams is very important for the future of a child, we should not enforce them to be occupied with it all the time. Instead, various social, fun and creative activities in free time will make them more prepared for the future.\n\n[Written by - Mahmud]Sample Answer 2:\nDifferent individuals have their own opinion on leisure time utilisation by students.

This statement will be analysed in the following paragraphs, supported by relevant examples.Regardless of how the educational scheme is provided, the low priced meals sold by fast food outlets are not likely to lose its popularity. Most of the members of the low class or unemployed students, for instance, are inevitably attracted to eating cheap fast food due to their financial difficulties.

However, with the advances in the technology, air travel was made available for the users at affordable rates. It is believed that decline in the air fare has a positive impact on the society. In this essay, we will analyse how this has boosted job availabilities and contributed towards deploying peace in the world.\n\nTo begin with, this kind of activity has enabled a large number of customers to travel abroad. As a consequence, demand for employees increased in the field of tourism and thereby, job opportunities were created for people interested in this field. In other words, a decrease in the cost of air ticket played a crucial role in the improvement of employment statistics around the world. Thus, it is apparent that drop in this fare has a direct impact on the increase in the work engagements for the needy.\n\nIn addition to this, low fare allows people to travel abroad for fulfilling their employment or education needs. This, in turn, allows them to get familiar with the culture of hosting country and hence, helps them to develop respect for inhabitants of that country. As a result, the chances of communal riots are decreased to a greater extent enabling people to live in peace. Therefore, the theory that reduced travel fares have helped individuals to stay in harmony is difficult to debunk.\n\nAfter analysing the areas of benefits for the society, it is clear that drop of ticket rate has benefited humans in various ways.

To tackle this, government\u2019s role will be analysed for viability and parents should take some steps as well.\n\nTo begin with, sadly some young people are more inclined towards their social life. Thus, in order to spend time with friends, they prefer setting meetings or parties at the public places. As a consequence, they create a lot of litter in gardens or parks, which not only spoils the beauty of the place but also contributes towards the pollution. Therefore, it is apparent that prioritising social life is the main cause of creating rubbish in public places. Though there are quite responsible youths yet there are some youth who seems very eager to show their power in the public places and they do whatever they wish. There are many ways how those bunch of young people are destroying the peacefulness of such public places. They often shout, talk to friends loudly which might be disturbing for others. Again, They often smoke in public places which are harmful to others and such young people care very less to respect the rules of those public place and often fight each other and show muscle powers to others which are very abominable especially in public places.\n\nTo counter this, the government should restrict people from using such places for their personal benefit. This can be done by enforcing strict rules and penalties if individuals organise any private event at such places. Apart from government\u2019s involvement in solving this urgent issue, the awareness among people must be increased. They should know the harmfulness and long-term effects of damaging public places and they should spontaneously volunteer to avoid this.\n\nAs it is seen that young generation is playing a crucial role in spoiling the communal places by producing garbage which results from the parties held at these places.

With the advancement in technology, an individual can access the information through electronic devices like computer, mobile phones, the internet etc. and thus the print media is losing its popularity. I agree with this statement that people should adopt the new technology and use electronic devices to get information rather than old ways of getting them.\n\nMultifarious points are there to prove my view. Firstly, accessing information in a computer with internet connection is very fast and convenient. People just need to enter a keyword in the search engine such as Google and the information can be assessed instantly from various reliable sources with detailed references. Secondly, individual have the opportunity to get different views regarding one particular subject which help them to broaden their horizons. Thirdly, today everybody wants to live a comfortable lifestyle and they have no need to carry other things and no need to pay extra on print media. Finally, the information presented in a print media becomes outdated soon while the information on the internet gets updated regularly. So accessing information from electronic sources is more reliable and accurate.\n\nOn the other hand, some people ponder that magazines and newspapers play an essential role because elder people do not know the 'ABC' about electronic gadgets so they are unable to use them to access information. They also add the logic that, on the internet, English is a staple language but some part of the population is not familiar with English which is really tough to understand for them. Finally, they assert that newspapers, magazines and books are printed in each language which provides them with a comfortable way of accessing them.\n\nIn a nutshell, I would like to conclude that government should organise awareness program for elders how they can use electronic devices because we all need to live in a modern society.

This essay will discuss the influence of a year gap on the teenagers and will lead to a reasoned conclusion.\n\nA deluge of merits can back this stance to take the break. The most preponderant is that students can alleviate their stress during the holiday period. For instance, students after studying for a long period, get a break to relax psychologically and physically. In addition to this, this would be the opportunity for them to travel outside the country, learn foreign culture and current market trends. So meanwhile they develop maturity and possess an enthusiasm for the university education. Hence it is apparent why students need a vacation before joining the university.\n\n\nOn the contrary, many students get deviated from their studies and feel difficult to start the academic education after having a long break. Some of the teenagers get attracted to the lavish lifestyles and prefer to adopt obnoxious habits. Needless, to say all these demerits have a far-reaching impact on the students.\n\nIn view of the arguments outlined above, we can conclude that the potential drawbacks of having a break after secondary education are too dire to ignore despite some merits.

One main cause is the ever-increasing population of the world which leads to the excessive usage of vehicles for travelling. This results in the traffic congestion and thereby, forces individuals to utilise honking system, which adds to the noise.

There are various reasons for this; however, certain safety measures, if adopted and followed, can mitigate the dangers associated with these sports.\n\nTo begin with, one of the predominant reasons for the popularity of some dangerous sports such as paragliding, bungee jumping and scuba diving is that people tend to take part in these sports to overcome and conquer their phobias and fears. Many people suffer from aquaphobia and acrophobia, and to free themselves from these fears, they indulge in some adventurous yet life-threatening sports. These sports, they believe, will boost their confidence and make them intrepid.  To exemplify this, I was extremely afraid of heights but to overcome this fear, I did paragliding not only once but thrice in a row on the same day even though I was aware of the risks involved. I am no longer afraid of tall buildings and extreme heights. Moreover, people have thrilling and exhilarating experience after doing these sports. They feel more alive and younger.\n\nTo mitigate the dangers involved in these sports, the most effective measure is to use proper safety gears and equipment such as harness, ropes and specialized clothing. Before doing the sport, the participants should be checked thoroughly to ensure that their specialized safety kit and gear is functioning properly. This practice, therefore, would reduce the risks involved. In addition to what has been mentioned, the specialists and experienced professionals should provide 1-2 days of training to interested participants to avoid any dangers. For example, before doing sky-diving, the professionals provide 2 days of coaching to the people who are going to take part in it. Moreover, participating in these hazardous sports must be avoided in extreme weather conditions, such as during rain and thunderstorms.\n\nIn conclusion, from a quick analysis of the situation, it is quite evident that people are inclined towards precarious sports as it helps them to conquer their fears.

As a result, they can offer good solutions in tight situations as in many cases they have had the similar experience before. For instance, they can foresee the bottlenecks and potential problems better than young staffs.

This is not appropriate because families should always care for their ageing members.", "extra_topic": "Do you agree or disagree with the above statement?", "model_answer": "\nWith the advent of advanced technologies, social liberation and fast paced lifestyles, family structures have changed considerably in order to adapt to environments they live in. One of the common patterns which have emerged lately is that of fewer children, working parents and elder members of the family living in retirement homes. Despite intuitive beliefs of this being inappropriate as families should always care for ageing members, there are practical reasons for such an arrangement being good for everyone. This essay outlines two such aspects to show why retirement homes are good for the elderly.\n\nFirstly, the loneliness which is one of the biggest difficulties of old age is automatically solved by retirement homes as people get to live with others of their own generation. For example, my grandparents could never relate to the 21st-century topics discussed at our family gatherings. They were more comfortable in bygone nostalgia and could very well mingle among people of their own generation. Such a company of people being easily available in retirement homes helps their mental health to be in a very good shape.\n\nSecondly, elderly people almost always need specialised care which they can feel confident about. Retirement homes are equipped with professionals to provide for the needs of their clientele. This is not always possible in a family of all working adults. Hence, retirement homes become a better case for the wellbeing of the elderly.\n\nSo, as seen from above two aspects of companionship and care, retirement homes are rather a better option for the elderly. Thus the taboo of retirement homes should be erased and they should be recognised as important institutions of our society.[Written by  - Tejas ]", "original_link": "https://www.ielts-mentor.com/writing-sample/writing-task-2/1404-ielts-writing-task-2-sample-402-elderly-people-often-live-in-retirement-homes"}, {"essay_topic": "For many people shopping unwanted things is just a form of entertainment.", "extra_topic": "Discuss both positive and negative points of this habit and give your opinion.", "model_answer": "\nIt is observed that people spend their leisure time performing one or other activity.

The primary reason for believing this is the fact that with the increase in the consumers in the market, there will be growth in the job opportunities.

They used to own more than eighty percent of the resources and income, while the rest is barely enough for the common people. Nowadays, the difference is significant but not limited to the societies finest.

If acceptable ease was managed for the common people in their daily routines like public transportations and business facilities, that would also be helpful. There must be transparent laws to manage the use of wealth and the equality of sharing it and monitor any possible corruption.

This industry is a major source of income in many countries. Some believe that tourists visiting these areas must be charged more than the local inhabitants. I personally disagree with this view because I think this plan will have more disadvantages.\n\nOn the one hand, those who support that, foreign travellers have to pay more for visiting historical places have their own reasons. One is that these people are averagely more well-to-do than the local residents. Paying hundreds of dollars for booking of hotel, airline or visa, foreign tourists are able to afford higher prices to visit these places. In this case, in Isfahan, a historical city of Iran, to visit \u2018Menar Jonban\u2019, an old tower located in the centre of the city, foreigners are charged five times more than the local inhabitants. While local citizens have to pay various taxes, foreigners visiting temporarily a place have not paid any tax; therefore, the regional government must charge them in other ways. To repair, renovate or protect these places, the local state will have more budgets.\n\nOn the other hand, I personally believe that the price of tickets for these locations must be the same for both local and foreign tourists. The first reason behind it is that this plan can avoid decreasing the number of visitors. Clearly, the more they are asked to pay, the less they will travel. As a prime example, had the government of B.C charged those foreigners visiting the national museum of Vancouver, their population would have dropped dramatically; however, by attracting more visitors, this government would have raised its revenue in other sectors, including hotels or public transportation, and foreigners would not have been forced to pay more money for visiting of these locations in Vancouver. Furthermore, this policy can have a huge negative impact on nations` relationships. Definitely, heritage premises are the best ways to show each nation`s culture, whereas increasing these fees will lead other nations to know less about the host country. In additional, this has a negative psychological effect on tourists while they are forced to pay more than the local visitors. They might feel discriminated and would plan to visit other places than spending more on cultural and historical places. Over the year the number of tourists would drop and that would be a bad impact in the long run.\n\nIn conclusion, although receiving more money from foreign visitors who visit historical places can have several advantages, I personally think that this will cause them to not only have less tendency to visit there again, but the host country will have less opportunity to show its culture to other nations.[ Written by - Rambod Taghaodi ]", "original_link": "https://www.ielts-mentor.com/writing-sample/writing-task-2/1401-ielts-writing-task-2-sample-399-foreign-visitors-should-be-charged-more-than-local-people"}, {"essay_topic": "Nowadays people live in the society where consumer goods are cheaper to buy.

For instance, new gadgets such as Android cell phones are available in the market at an acceptable price that everyone can afford. In a sense, the widespread use of such technological devices has improved the way we communicate but this is also creating a throwaway society. The gap between the rich and poor has narrowed in terms of their ability to purchase consumer products. Living standard has improved and basic needs are easily met these days and more people have the opportunities to select from more options. As a result, people are purchasing things that do not even need. A single person has multiple cell phones and they are busy all day with their cell phones and internet. Thus people are becoming less social. The technology changes rapidly and thus people need to change the model of a product within few months.

Nonetheless, this moving of an enormous number of people creates problems. Firstly, the urban population would go on increasing, because of this, there would be the housing problem.

Secondly, in most of the cases, people in large cities might not obtain the job after several trials which lead to deterioration of their standard of living. The overpopulation is big cities would create more pollutions, would increase the crime rate and traffic congestion would become worse.

This is a major concern for governments as it not only increase the cost of living but also affects the quality of life for its residents. I do agree that only governments can solve this problem by taking various measures, such as restricting landed houses to save the space, encouraging vertical residential buildings and gradually expanding the city.\n\nIn the olden days, people lived in landed independent houses as there were lots of spaces in the city. However, this is not possible in the modern cities as the city population is increasing rapidly, and resulting in a space shortage situation for accommodating housing for all. One of the action governments can take is to discourage building new landed houses and encourage people to live in apartment flats. For instance, Singapore government has built thousands of high-floor residential flats through housing development board to accommodate its ever-growing residents in an affordable way. It also stopped permission for building new landed houses to deal with the space crunch.\n\nSome governments are also looking at options for expanding the city to create more residential properties. For example, Bangalore, one of the fast growing cities in India is continuously expanding by incorporating more residential properties and other infrastructure at the outskirts of the city, which gradually becomes part of the growing city. However, this option is viable only when there are enough spaces surrounding the city. For cities like Hong-Kong and Singapore, which are islands, the only option is to grow vertically within the city. Solving housing shortage is an issue that requires proper planning and big investment and residence of a big city have very little to do and the government seems like the appropriate authority to solve this problem.  \n\nIn conclusion, the cities are growing rapidly and so the residents of the city also grow.

I personally believe that private companies should be given their own freedom in doing research, but with sufficient and proper monitoring from the government.\n\nOn one hand, it is true that scientific research should not be only conducted by the government. The main reason is that the scope of scientific research is diverse and wide, and private companies could cover up some research which is not carried out by the governments. Many private institutions or individuals' discoveries are useful for the humanity, as we can learn from the past. For example, Thomas Alva Edison was an individual inventor who has greatly contributed to the world with his inventions such as the bulb light, motion pictures, phonograph and so on. We should notice that the invention was not the main focus of the government\u2019s research during that time, and thanks to Edison we have electric light today.\n\nOn the other hand, although private companies are given the right to do scientific research, they must be strictly monitored by the governments. They must be controlled, as some of them might be doing it for their monetary gain or for destructive weapons.

It is the governments\u2019 job to prevent and block these kinds of research.  \n\nIn conclusion, I do not agree that scientific research should only be conducted by the governments.

Another positive effect is accessing a better housing. Using the state-of-the-art designs in buildings, individuals have a better feeling and higher quality of lifestyle.

While some individuals think that paying taxes is sufficient to fulfill in the contribution of this success, I personally believe that this is not enough and other important factors, including protecting of resources, following the rules and defending their country against hazards must be considered too.\n\nObviously, preservation of the environment is one of the most important responsibilities of citizens in each country. To avoid wasting of energy, people have to conserve it by following of some important outlines imposed by governments. As a prime example, to generate electricity for each house annually, thousands of liters of fossil fuels must be consumed, damaging the wildlife tremendously; therefore, each member of a family has to use the least amount of energy, assisting other generations to have access to a safer environment and more natural resources.\n\nThe second responsibility is that people should follow the civil acts. Definitely, each citizen has to abide the rules imposed by authorities, leading fewer budgets being spent on the protection of privacy of societies. For example, had the people of Tehran, the capital city of Iran, followed the rules of the Citizenship Act, fewer funds would have been used by the government, and this money would have been consumed in other important sectors.\n\nLastly, to protect their country, individuals must be responsible. Clearly, although people have to be involved in the monetary issues of their country, their roles in important decisions are more important too. They must be active in political elections, unpredictable invasions, or even during propagation of contaminated diseases. In particular, to protect their continent against Ebola, a dreadful virus causing thousands of mortality around the world in 2014, many Africans had felt a responsibility to defend their country against this virus.\n\nIn conclusion, although paying taxes is considered as an important duty of citizens, other responsibilities must not be forgotten. I think individuals must be active persons in other parts too, including when it comes to the protection of the habitat, country, and abiding by citizens.[ Written by - Rambod Taghaodi ]", "original_link": "https://www.ielts-mentor.com/writing-sample/writing-task-2/1385-ielts-writing-task-2-sample-382-paying-taxes-is-enough-to-contribute-to-the-society"}, {"essay_topic": "Some languages are increasingly spoken in different countries, while the usage of others is rapidly declining.

Although some may agree that this has been more beneficial to societies, I personally think that its drawbacks have surpassed the advantages.\n\nOn the one hand, talking with some specific dialect has had two important benefits. The first one is that trading has become far easier. Businesspersons knowing English language are statistically more prosperous in their business because they can communicate better with their partners than the one not knowing English. The owners of many multinational corporations are originally from English countries or live there, including Microsoft, Google in the USA or British Petroleum in the UK. As a result, these traders can have a better connection to their partners, becoming more successful in their business. Moreover, immigrants can have more comfortable lifestyles abroad. For instance, an Iranian doctor, who is perfect in the English language, can have more opportunity than the one less knowing it.\n\nOn the other hand, I personally believe that other dialects must not be forgotten, and I give the green light to those supporting them. The most important reason behind it is that traditions will be loosed. Clearly, to recognise each nation, knowing about their culture is extremely crucial, and the best device is learning its language. As a prime example, many of Arabic historical transcripts, which show Arabs` history, would have been difficult to be understood if they had been changed to other languages. Their culture would have gradually been replaced with other words, and a cultural invasion would have occurred. In addition, domination of few languages can reduce the rating success of those students talking in other languages. Obviously, developing country scholars studying in developed countries have faced numerous challenges because of language; however, if they had studied in their country, they would have become more successful graduates. In particular, a Persian engineer who has moved to Canada is usually less prosperous than a Canadian one to sit a position in an English language college.\n\nIn conclusion, although the domination of some languages has had several advantages, the importance of other languages should not be neglected.

In many countries, democracy had been the best type of living condition, and voting was the best device for achieving it. However, unfortunately, frauds prohibited them from becoming prosperous in this matter. As a prime example, Iranians participated many times in the national presidential elections to opt their favourable president, but their votes were not counted. Another factor is war. Unpredictably, nations faced sudden battles, affecting their lifestyles.

One is that their citizens pay tax. To assist low-income residents, charity sectors are better to help the donated money, paid by their own people, to native residents than the foreigners because their people pay tax and they have priority to other nations. Another reason behind it is that this can positively affect the rate of crime. The more the poor are supported financially, the less they commit crimes. They have less motivation to provide their essential needs in inappropriate ways, and citizens will have a safer living condition.

Tobacco is one such drug, which is considered to be in the top four of most addictive drugs. Many believe that owing to its addiction and its treacherous effects on human body, it should be banned. In apropos of the argument, I am in consummate accord with it and I believe that consumption of tobacco in any form must be prohibited. This opinion is surrounded by multiple arguments as below.\n\nTo begin with, people are increasingly showing the propensity of using tobacco products because of the change in social structure. In other words, over the years, most of the families have become nuclear and adults are not under any guidance to be protected from smoking habits. For an instance, as per a survey in the USA, 70% of the adults have affirmed that they were inclined to use cigarettes as they did not have anyone at home to guide and show adequate direction. Thus, the onus is on the government to declare tobacco production and sell as illegal.\n\nIn addition, smoking has horrendous repercussion on the human body, which is evidently paralysing the youth of a nation. In a survey in the USA, 60% of the teenagers have confirmed addiction and health ailments germinated by such drugs. Admittedly, it is weakening a nation's health index and consequently, its prosperity. As a result, it is mandatory to ban such drugs to reinvigorate the health of the denizens.\n\nTo sum up, owing to tobacco's addictive features and its adverse effects on human health, it is imperative that government must interfere and prohibit such drugs to be sold and used.[ Written by - Anshuman Mishra ]", "original_link": "https://www.ielts-mentor.com/writing-sample/writing-task-2/1381-tobacco-is-a-kind-of-drug-and-it-should-be-illegal-to-use"}, {"essay_topic": "Some people say that parents have the most important role in a child\u2019s development.

One is that they are more reliable. Children have a better bonding with their parents than their friends or even teachers because they spend more time with their parents than any other individual. As a prime example, a toddler can develop his speech better when he copies his mother\u2019s word and his mother has been the only reliable person who has had sufficient care and supervision. Another reason is that parents are usually more familiar with their offspring\u2019s mood and behaviours. They are the first ones who can find their children\u2019s personality problems due to longer time they have been spending with them. For instance, a mother is able to detect better his child\u2019s depression symptoms than even any other professionals.\n   \nOn the other hand, parents\u2019 knowledge might not be enough for the upbringing of their children, and I believe that friends or television have more pivotal roles. The first reason behind it is that their friends are considerably more up-to-date than their parents. Clearly, developing of technology, each generation has more valuable information than parents. In particular, had not adolescents had enough social communication with their classmates, they would not have become familiar with latest versions of social networks and would have become more isolated. In addition, watching scientific programmes, they will be able to upgrade their information about the latest educational findings than when they just rely on their parents\u2019 training. For example, to learn the English language, there are plenty of precious video clips on YouTube that perfect instructors teach grammar, vocabulary or speaking, which are extremely useful for all viewers, including children.\n\nIn conclusion, although some people may agree that parents can be better origins for growing of their children, I personally think that the role of medium and their classmates could be more impressive.[ Written by - Rambod ]", "original_link": "https://www.ielts-mentor.com/writing-sample/writing-task-2/1380-ielts-writing-task-2-sample-377-parents-have-the-most-important-role-in-a-child-s-development"}, {"essay_topic": "We no longer need to have animals kept in zoos, so zoos should be closed.", "extra_topic": "Do you agree or disagree?", "model_answer": " (Disagreement)\nIt is widely seen today that the government is diverting a lot of funds towards development and maintenance of zoos.

We all know that good teachers enlighten our life and lead us to the way of success. No doubt, ideal teachers can be made through several ways. Chief among them are the university education and the good motives from the directors of the school.\n\nThe first way how can we make ideal teachers is by a good education. It is an indisputable fact that a good education during university study brings about perfect teachers. If the students are taught by professional teachers, then they will become increasingly expert teachers in their major. Consequently, such students, when becoming teachers, will be ideal teachers and will produce high-quality educated students. In contrast, when students are taught by bad teachers, no progress will be made and, to some extent, the students\u2019 education will dramatically deteriorate.\n\nThe second method of creating an ideal teacher is a good motive. No wonder if we say that the good motive, especially by managers, pleases the teachers and makes them do their best in their work. Additionally, managers are fully responsible for their teachers. In other words, such managers should always praise their teachers whenever those teachers do anything well. In such way, teachers will feel that they are doing something great and will pursue their good. Hence, the students will get useful benefits from those excellent teachers.\n\nThirdly, the talent of teaching is something many people are privileged with and those people should be selected and motivated to become teachers. Not all good students can become ideal and successful teachers and that should be kept in mind while selecting them. The government should increase the facilities for teachers so that talented students aspiring to become teachers and the education system of a country should be formed in such a way so that teaching becomes a lucrative and prestigious profession.\n\nIn conclusion, ideal teachers are the backbones of the students and no one can deny the essential and vital role they play. With a good university education and a good motive, we can get perfect teachers.

While the length of service is undoubtedly an important factor, my belief is it should certainly not be the only criterion for deciding who should be promoted. Rather it would be best for companies to have a more varied policy in this area. There are without question sound arguments for promoting employees who have been working for a company for a number of years.\n\nThe first of these is that these more experienced employees would be able to adapt themselves to be in a higher position. As they would understand the culture and policies of the company better, they should be given priority to be in higher positions in a company. Again, on a practical level, if they were not promoted, they might well leave the company to find a higher position and earn a larger salary. This could have serious consequences for the company, which might lose a significant amount of business to its competitors.\n\nDespite these factors, there is a strong argument in favour of also promoting staff because of their performance. This can be seen by how some multinational companies use annual performance and development reviews when deciding on promotion. Under this system, a supervisor can set targets for an employee and if those targets are met, then the staff can be promoted, even if they are relatively junior. The benefit of this approach is that it encourages staff to work harder and rewards merit and not just slow service.\n\nIn conclusion, there is no doubt a case for implementing a policy of promoting long serving members of staff, but I believe that it is also wise to take account of the performance of more junior members of staff.[ by - Basnet ]", "original_link": "https://www.ielts-mentor.com/writing-sample/writing-task-2/1369-ielts-writing-task-2-sample-372-staff-who-worked-in-a-company-for-a-long-time-should-be-promoted"}, {"essay_topic": "Do you believe that societies ought to enforce capital punishment or are there alternative forms of punishment that would be better used?", "extra_topic": "What is your viewpoint on this?", "model_answer": "\nIs the death penalty an effective deterrent?

An effective approach is to adapt school curricula from other countries that have higher literacy and numeracy levels into our local study programs.\n\nTo conclude, literacy and numeracy skills are intertwined with our daily lives, therefore it is of the utmost importance to maintain a certain level of standards.\n\n(by  - Kelly Ke)Sample Answer 2:\nIt would be quite right to profess that the declination of educational quality, particularly in literature and mathematics, has globally grabbed attention among the populace over the last decades.

In addition, the second technique of problem-solving that can reform this dilemma is expediting immigration of young skilled workers and experienced engineers from less developed countries. Nowadays, a wide spectrum of states implements this policy. As an outstanding instance, Australia has facilitated the entrance of migrants.

There are various reasons behind it. This illness originates from diet, sedentary lifestyle and genetics. I personally believe that three critical reasons of unhealthy diet, sedentary lifestyle and genetics considerably contribute to the development of such diseases in teenagers.\n\nThe first cause of obesity is fatty food. Todays, most of the children are interested in junk food and fizzy drinks like sandwiches, chips and coke. These kinds of foods are not nutritious. Furthermore, a huge number of parents buy fast food for their children instead of preparing calorie-rich food at home. This issue can be solved by purchasing food from traditional restaurants (that they cook local foods), banning junk foods and advertising healthy foods in mass media, schools and textbooks.\n\nThe second reason for obesity is an inactive lifestyle. The use of technological devices has gradually risen among children. They spend most of the time watching TV or playing video games on a computer, so the progress of these tools has led to declining the physical activities. This obstacle can be resolved by paying attention to bodily activities in schools and encouraging children to participating in sporting events. Moreover, parents can restrict playing video games on weekdays. In addition to this, the government can compel mass communication to advertise physical exercises.\n\nThe third factor of obesity is genetics. Although genetics play a significant role in obesity of children, we cannot change or fortify our genetics. But human beings especially parents must visit genetics experts or do genetics tests before their child is born.\n\nIn conclusion, obesity derives from several considerable components like foods, sedentary lifestyle and genetics.

Although we suffer less from the pains and tiredness of manual work, we are in fact afflicted by the sedentary lifestyle of office work, as many critics suggest. Personally, I agree with this idea.\n\nFor people working in offices, sitting for too long in the soft chair or sofa is the direct cause of a number of diseases. As is often the case, workers in offices tend to deal with their work either by using the computer or by checking documents and writing reports. And all such work requires a person to sit in a chair by a desk for a long time. This will cause backaches, neck aches as few people have a good sitting habit and it is even harder for them to sit properly in a long time. Secondly, sitting for a long time means they cannot exercise their body or simply stretch out their arms and legs often, which results in bad blood circulation and even obesity. Worse still, they can suffer from psychological pressure for lack of exercises that are essential to personal happiness.\n\nHowever, some argue that sedentary lifestyle in offices is not the direct cause of a lot of diseases. They claim that although office work requires them to sit for long, they can relax and exercise their body after work and at weekends. The fallacy in this argument is that it thinks many people are so energetic that they are eager to exercise themselves after a long day of exhaustion due to their work, not to mention that at weekends people are not always free to do anything they want to do.\n\nIn conclusion, it is reasonable to say that sedentary lifestyle of office work is the direct cause of a number of diseases.

Many people believe that this trend is dropping tremendously today. I agree that people no longer use these skills to earn a living and in fact, this phenomenon is also happening in my country. In the following paragraph, I will explain my views and the reasons why the skills are vanishing around the world.\n\nMany people remain convinced that the vast technological development has brought the disappearance of these skills. Take the case of computers, for example. It is true that the development of a trend of sending emails through computers take place in recent decades and these developments have replaced the traditional practice of writing letters with pens or pencils. Similarly, after the inventions of a cloth making the machine or repairing the machine, the majority of people have become more relied on these machines rather than the manpower. Since these inventions make the whole manufacturing or repairing process become more time and cost effective, it is easy to see why more and more businessmen choose to build factories with machines while hiring fewer and fewer people who have the skill of making clothes or repairing items.\n\n\nAt the same time, I think that similar situations are happening in my country. Considering the fact that more and more people are switching the jobs from a manufacturing or repairing worker to a machine technician in the past few years, this cannot be denied. Given that the trend of industrialisation is still growing in my country, people eventually forget all these skills secondary to disuse. In the employees' mind, new factories with machines have higher profits and if they quit the job as a worker, they will be more likely to get a better-paid job and thus increase their living standards in future. Therefore, there is no doubt that the technical advances in my home country result in the disappearance of these skills as fewer people are willing to continue working for their original job.\n\n\n20-30 years earlier, people did not have the technological advancements and that's why they were taught from their childhood how to do certain household things like repairing a tool or making clothes. Nowadays, parents do not focus that much on teaching their children of those skills. People mostly rely on machines, technological tools and skilled professionals for such things while they focus on education and getting specialised on their own field rather than gaining those short of skills.\n\nIn conclusion, I would like to reiterate that the technical development has brought the disappearance of these skills as the whole process has become efficient whereas in many employees' perspective, the incentive of not adopting these skills by switching their job nature allows them to become more wealthy and successful in future and this phenomenon is also commonly seen around the world including my country.[by Angela]", "original_link": "https://www.ielts-mentor.com/writing-sample/writing-task-2/1340-ielts-writing-task-2-sample-350-nowadays-skills-like-these-are-disappearing"}, {"essay_topic": "Originality does not mean thinking something that was never thought before: it means putting old ideas together in new ways.", "extra_topic": "", "model_answer": "\nLast two decades surprisingly changed our lifestyles with technological improvements and advent of new devices such as smartphones, smart watches and 3D supporting smart televisions.

Due to this fact, it is the most expensive energy source for today and will be in the future until its extinction. Also, anyone who wants to collect fuel should build expensive plants and as a result of this sector is controlled by big companies that are known as main subsidises and profiteers of wars. Furthermore, economic effects of fuel make world peace nearly impossible. Many wars erupt because of this material most people concern that \"World War III\" will strike because of it.\n\nOn the other hand, safe alternative energy receives its power from nature. Such as, hydropower plants, solar power farms and wind power tribunes. Because of these, possibilities of this limitless power are way too higher than fossil fuel. Also, anyone who wants to collect one of these powers only needs to build the corresponding facility on his area and if produced power is higher than his requirement he could even sell it to the government regarding the newly approved bill.\n\nIn conclusion, usage of this limitless power will definitely take a great part of our future and because of its possibilities, governments should pay more attention.[by - Demir]", "original_link": "https://www.ielts-mentor.com/writing-sample/writing-task-2/1335-ielts-writing-task-2-sample-345-the-exploration-and-development-of-safe-alternatives-of-fossil-fuels"}, {"essay_topic": "Every country has poor people and every country has different ways of dealing with the poor.

Some people find it hard to manage their time to be successful and fully responsible at their workplace and at the same time spend quality time with their families. This is certainly a problem faced by many.\n\nThere is no doubt that in the highly competitive business environment, it is extremely difficult not to be competitive at work. Many workers are trying to survive and be successful and this forces them to spend more than eight hours per day at work. For example, an accountant not only uses to manage his responsibilities and duties but also does additional work. To manage that it is possible to limit employee\u2019s responsibilities or share them with others.\n\nThe next point that needs to be taken into consideration is that people should manage their responsibilities at home like washing, cleaning, ironing and also, communicate with other family members. To be able to do so, they must manage to not be overtired from their responsibilities at work. In this case, they will be able to spend quality time with their families and maintain their responsibilities.\n\nThe competition at a workplace, increased population and our demand to do best in every sector is the main reason we are not being able to balance in our professional and personal life. The decreased family bonding and less time for socialising are two main reasons for this heinous trend. To tackle this we need to spend more time with our family members and contribute to household works. More time should be reserved for the dear and near one than spending those times in electronic devices. The value of family bonding should be taught from the early childhood and the parents should make examples through their works to teach children the importance of family value.\n\nTo sum up, there are a lot of people who cannot successfully manage their responsibilities and keep work-home balance.

This level of interaction impacts students positively who can understand better the topic after class participation. Additionally, during the lecture or tutorial teachers can explain the material in an easier or simpler way than it could be read from the book.  As a result of class attendance, students will not only have greater knowledge and have a deeper understanding of the topic but also will be able to solve questions based on the topic, pass a course and use this knowledge for their future careers. Teachers who conduct classes not only talk about the subject matter, but also tell stories and share their experience which is helpful for students to understand or remember a topic. Teachers also inspire students, give helpful guidelines and refer related books so that students can learn even better. If someone does not attend classes, he will less likely make friends and will miss the valuable lessons taught by the teachers.  \n\nOn the other hand, in some situations attending classes should not be mandatory. For example, students may be absent because of sickness, jobs, family needs or the necessity to take care of children or the urgent need to be in a different place during the class time.

I completely agree that computer games should be prohibited in classrooms, schools and libraries. There are various reasons for my opinion and the following paragraphs will discuss my reasons in details.First of all, academic boundaries and libraries are primarily for gathering knowledge, learning new lessons and focusing on study. If students start playing computer games in classrooms and in libraries, they will definitely be distracted from their main objective in schools and thus they will perform very poorly in exams.

They think that there are better alternatives for this type of rewards. In my opinion money as a reward in combination with other motivations can be the best way for encouraging people to work harder.First of all, one of the main reasons people work in an office is money. No matter how cordially we deny the fact that we work for money, the reality is we need money to support our family, our personal needs and to live in this world. There are definitely other factors like job satisfaction, passion for work, working environment, career prospect, relationship with co-workers and bosses that determine whether an employee is motivated to work in an organisation or not but the money the employee gets at the end of each week or month is the main determining factor.

There are many steps we can take to reduce the number of private motor vehicles running on roads to ensure the safety of the environment and to make the world livable for the upcoming generations.First of all, improving the public transportation system would encourage people to use those instead of relying on their private cars. People mostly buy private cars to have a comfortable commuting experience though maintaining private cars is far more expensive. If the public transportation facility is improved, many people would reduce using their private vehicles. Secondly, increasing the price of fuel could be another great measure to discourage people from using and buying private cars.

Though success in life is a relative term and could vary greatly from person to person, being able to fulfil dreams and ambitions and being able to be recognised among people is a common definition we can attach to the term success. While a sports personality desire success by doing some ground breaking records in his sports, a new actor can dream to perform in a big budget hit movie as his success. When this actor gains some fame, he might desire to win the Oscar prize and can make it his milestone for success. It is often said that success might be easy to gain but more difficult to maintain and I completely agree with this notion.First of all, hard work, determination and talent are required to gain success.

A singer, movie actor and sportsman can gain fame and success by showing superb performance once and everybody will then look at them and expect them to perform well continuously.

The owner can go up vertically to have more rooms or can plant trees whenever he wants. That's the kinds of freedom that make houses more desirable to most people. There is no restriction on how a landlord can design or paint the house or how large he wants the lawn to be. Finally, the price of land increases every year and investment in a house is profitable. However, these freedoms do not come cheap. The soaring real state price makes it impossible for most people to even think of owning a house in a city. Furthermore, the maintenance of a large house requires employees and money and the owner has to ensure the safety of the house on his own.   \n\nOn the other hand, an apartment is a relatively modern accommodation arrangement for small families and are built by real state developers keeping modern facilities in mind. The customers can get everything readymade, sometimes even fully furnished rooms and kitchen. This eliminates the hassle of building a house and decorating it.

In this essay, I would like to express my personal point of view upon this subject.First of all, I am fully agreed with the title of this essay and I consider it as the real challenge in modern society. People are using many contemporary gadgets these days which give them lots of opportunities to know the things inside out. But the most intriguing and absorbing themes for ordinary people are articles in gossip columns of many newspapers and glossy magazines about movie and pop stars, their glamorous way of living and scandals on their love affairs. Television contributes the problem too, as it shows too much of private and secret details of contemporary stars. The audience is disquiet over big money celebrities and other famous people earn, the clothes they wear, cars they drive and homes they live in and so on. Nowadays it is very popular to know many specific ins and outs of our favourite idols. In addition for many teenagers and young adults these public people are heroes and examples to follow. They admire and fall in love with celebrities, discuss their difficulties and try to get closer to them through the internet, people subscribe for the personal pages of singers, film stars, TV presenters, politicians and others in popular social networks.", "original_link": "https://www.ielts-mentor.com/writing-sample/writing-task-2/1295-ielts-writing-task-2-sample-305-media-pay-too-much-attention-to-the-personal-lives-of-famous-people"}, {"essay_topic": "Is freedom of speech necessary in a free society?", "extra_topic": "", "model_answer": "\nFreedom of speech is very important for a citizen to upgrade himself and society.

It gives people courage to communicate to make decisions and work on that. For Example Politician: they speak in public places to make the commitments and plans to develop the country. The audiences listen to them patiently, analyse their words and gives approval in the form of votes to win, so that he can get a chance to work on his promises and commitments.\n\nFurthermore, freedom is a fragrance of beautiful society. It makes you extrovert and nourishes you to achieve defined goal. Whereas this privileged is only limited to politicians these days. Those who are not politicians and if they speak something true about someone, they can be killed or murdered, if the opponent party is stronger than them. It also limits anyone to take decisions and forces you to think 100 times before speaking in a public place.

Examiners need to go the extra mile to select the right mode of assessment. Though some people prefer periodical assessment method for evaluation, my two cent is that a formal examination is an excellent tool for better assessment.\n\nOne of the obvious reasons, it is a clear and objective method of assessment. In other words, formal examination method has widely accepted for it judicial and nonbiased nature. Moreover, it facilitates a proper assessment of students with accurate evidence. Over and above, it breaches the barriers of technical criteria of assessments such as grading. Hence, this method brings about less parental complaints about student assessments. The recent parental survey in Japan proves that the most accepted methods of parents is nothing other than formal examinations, is the best epitome.\n\nAnother reason, the exam pressure helps the students to get on with their future hectic career. It is a gospel truth that the formal examination normally creates a good deal of internal pressure among students. This pressure equips the students to put in a stressful situation in their future career. If the students practice this kind of situations in their early life, it will pay the dividend in future. On top of that, this practice brings about a sea change in students personal life as well. They take an effective decision as easy as pie in stressful situations in their personal life. Many business executives reveal that their success formula of personal and professional life is nothing other than the ability to work under pressure situations, that achieved by their school life is the best example.\n\nIronically, an army of people argues that an extra workload comes about on students at the exam time. Perhaps it may be true to some degree but, there is always a light at the end of the tunnel. The pupil will be beneficial in future by these slightly vigorous practices in their school period.\n\nPut it in a nutshell, the formal examination is prejudice free and not a rocket science for students and their parents. In addition to that, if they go by formal exam process in their school hood, the students become an extra talented in future.

This method can be useful in some aspects. I think they can save not only their money but they can raise their safety and improve their family relationships too.\n \nObviously, this types of careers are far economical than working in the office. Paying for public transportation tickets or private vehicle gas, people have to spend several hundreds of dollars each month to commute between their home and workplace; however, those working from home do not spend this money and can save it. For example, my brother, who works for a mobile company in Australia, has to pay almost $300 per month to travel from his apartment to his workplace located in downtown, while he would not pay it when his employer permitted him to work from home, and he would save over $3500 annually.\n \nAnother reason is that this method is far safer than the working in the office. Had not many electronic engineers had to travel between their home and the company they are working, they would not have been injured or even died because of road accidents. Many of them have to use their private car to reach their destination, and unfortunately, because of sudden car accidents, their lives have been jeopardised.\n \nLastly, this method can improve family relationships. Clearly, this group of employees usually stay longer hours a day in their house and are definitely a longer time in contact with their spouse or children than the ones working in the outside home. In this way, a friend of mine who his office is a room inside of his house can have closer communication with his children because he can monitor his children's activities, including their study or playing, and he is more familiar with his wife's personality than a similar personnel who have to work more than eight hours a day in his workplace.\n \nIn conclusion, those working from home can gain more advantages than the ones working from the office.

It is a tough nut to crack for many nations.

It is a gospel truth that, if private vehicles such as motorcycles and cars get decreased on roads, the traffic congestion will significantly decline. Moreover, it brings about a sea of changes in traffic culture by avoiding road rage, which is another cause of traffic jam in many cities. So, promotion of common transports keeps the roads  free and city travel becomes a piece of cake. According to the recent survey of Volvo company, in New York city, the traffic congestion is significantly down than any other cities in the USA because of excellent public transport system usage of public, is the best epitome.\n\nSecondly, public vehicles such as buses and trams can slow down the movement on the road. To be more precise, the slow movement of vehicles pays an extra dividend to bring down traffic congestion in cities. Moreover, avoiding unnecessary overtaking and similar driving activities come about by use of common traffic vehicles. Hence, the traffic jam can bring down in a great deal. Exclusive areas of buses and trams in cities have been experiencing less traffic congestion is the best epitome of it.\n\nHowever, an army of people argues that the public transport system increases the travelling time and give cold comfort to commuters. Perhaps it may be true to some degree but, it cannot be denied that the vehicle speed down is an effective solution for smooth and traffic jam free city travel.\n\nTo crown it all, encouraging the public to get along with the common transport system is the best option to bring down city traffic clogging.

Clearly, instructors teaching in a vast area cannot focus on each applicant; however, dividing all students into five to ten pupils in each group can assist them to become more active in their study, raising the quality of teaching generally.

It has been argued that the government should only be accountable for developing country\u2019s military capabilities and infrastructure enhancement or it should be responsible for other important facilities i.e. education, medical, social protection as well. I strongly believe that all the aspects of life associated with state citizens should be directly undertaken, developed, maintained and operated by the state authorities. This argument will be proven by taking into account availability of resources with government and monopoly by private entities and individuals.Firstly, the funds and financing available by the state is substantially high giving them the cushion to allocated funds and projects for every sector according to its requirements. For instance, the state collects the tax from its citizens on the reason and commitment that the taxpayer\u2019s money will again be spent by utilising on the development and improvement of the infrastructure, healthcare, transportation system etc. On the contrary if it refuses to oblige and falls back on the commitment of spending money on public it could result in reduction in popularity and tax collection.

This is the main reason why defining happiness is not that easy. However, there are some common things that are regarded important to be delighted in life.   \n\nDefining happiness is quite challenging because the requirements to achieve it is not fixed. While someone dreams that his economic freedom would make him happy, a very rich man dreams about having a caring family to be happy. Similarly, a couple who do not have any child think about having a baby all the time and would be ready to do anything for that. On the contrary, many poor families, mostly in poor countries, find more children to be their burden. The practical world is quite puzzling and the humankind wants more than they have.

First of all, physical and psychological soundness is very important to be happy and people can truly realise that when they get sick. Economic freedom - ability to fulfil the needs in life, is the second most important factor to be happy, in my opinion. It is often said that being happy with an empty stomach is not possible. Thirdly, having a happy family where members love each other and care for them is considered important to be in peace in life. It is usually rare to find a happy person who does not have a pleasant family. Individual freedom is also considered a great influence to be happy in life. Someone without personal freedom cannot feel the happiness. Most importantly, being contented in life is the key to being happy. If someone can be contented with whatever little he has, he will be happy in life.\n\n\nIn conclusion, though there is no easy and precise definition of happiness, common attributes like sound health, caring family, freedom and personal contentment are regarded to be key ingredients to be happy in life.

I believe that salaries, working environment and career enhancement opportunity are the key determinants to job satisfaction. However, with different occupations, expectations may still vary, and I think that satisfaction with jobs remains a distant dream for the majority of employees.\n\nTo begin with, job satisfaction depends on several fitting reasons, like salaries, working environment and development prospects, for example. Firstly, wages play a predominant role in affecting job content. In simple words, money helps employees attain their basic needs. Besides, it is deemed a symbol of accomplishment as higher salaries reflect a higher degree of contribution to the organization. Secondly, the working environment also plays a crucial role in influencing job contentment. That is to say that employees need an atmosphere which is safe and healthy, and which caters to both personal comforts and is conducive to doing a good job. Last but not least, the potential for career advancement is another factor in a delightful career. This is because employees regard promotion as the ultimate achievement and when they get a promotion, they feel absolutely satisfied.\n\n\nHowever, it is quite impossible for all employees to be completely satisfied with their job and workplace. In fact, a high-paid job exerts an enormous amount of stress. An employee who comes under pressure to work longer hours will not be satisfied with the profession, whereas a flexible job that entertains executives\u2019 passion likely has low salaries. It appears that human nature is the formidable challenge for employees to find satisfaction in their occupations.\n\n\nIn conclusion, salaries, stimulating working environment and promotional chance are the major sources of job satisfaction but human traits are actually a great hindrance to working delight and job satisfaction for all is not possible.Sample Answer 2:\nSince the majority of adults spend a considerable amount of their time at work, job satisfaction has become instrumental in the well-being of an individual. This essay will first discuss what elements contribute to job satisfaction, and it will then address the question of how likely it is that everyone will be happy with their jobs.\n\nThe two most important things that lead to someone being satisfied at work are being treated with respect by managers and being compensated fairly. If those who are senior to individual respect them as a person and value their contribution at work then this will elate the person and make them feel valued. Fair compensation is also an important consideration because feeling underpaid can cause people to resent their bosses or look for another job. According to a recent survey by online job search website Monster.com, these two factors came on top where almost 80% agree that they would stick to their respective job roles if valued by managers and offered fair remuneration.\n\nWith regards to the second question, it is unlikely that all workers can experience content with their career. The majority of people fail to reach their goal and as a result, end up taking a post they really do not care about in return for a salary. The money earned is just enough to pay their living expenses which often means they go through periods of discontentment. For example, a poll conducted by the Guardian.com states that 70% of the people would leave their current job if it were not for the money.\n\nTo conclude, being content with one\u2019s career can have a profound impact on a person's well-being, and being paid fairly can maximise their sense of self-worth; however, job satisfaction for all workers is an unrealistic hope.", "original_link": "https://www.ielts-mentor.com/writing-sample/writing-task-2/1216-how-realistic-is-the-expectation-of-job-satisfaction-for-all-workers"}, {"essay_topic": "Many parents use punishment to teach the difference between right and wrong to kids.

Governments throughout the world should make education compulsory for all children between the ages of 5 and 15.", "extra_topic": "", "model_answer": "\nNowadays, education is viewed as an essential factor in building a promising future for our society. Leaders and other governing bodies see it as a priority issue for the world's progress and development, hence, many believe that it should be mandated for children, especially, during the early stage of their development. This argument can be supported by stating its benefits, not only to children but to their parents and to the society in general.\n\nFirst and foremost, compulsory education for children will hone their personality in a well-controlled and well-mannered environment. For instance, teachers manage the classrooms and make sure that it is suitable for learning. They also teach their students new knowledge, guide them in learning new skills and discipline them in order to build new moral character. Thus, the school helps to hone an individual a positive personality that will soon be an asset to the society.\n\nSecondly, if the government will mandate primary education, parents will have no choice but to send their children to school. They will need to provide necessary support, not only in the moral aspects but financial aspects of schooling. These facts will promote responsible parenthood.\n\nLastly, through mandatory education, each and every individual will have an understanding and greater awareness of the issues to make the world a better place. Therefore, eliminating ignorance and illiteracy that create gaps within the society can be done through the mandatory education system. In fact, the schooling of children in many countries is mandatory and it reflects the needs of education for all in the societies.\n\nIn summary, the benefits brought about by compulsory education are beneficial and is a vital factor in the society's development.( by Karen Kate )", "original_link": "https://www.ielts-mentor.com/writing-sample/writing-task-2/1205-ielts-writing-task-2-sample-286-governments-should-make-education-compulsory-for-all-children"}, {"essay_topic": "Young drug abuse is a serious problem nowadays in many countries.

Obviously, drug dealers have expanded their territories in many countries, like Columbia in the South America or Afghanistan in Asia, and their control has become far more challenging than in the past. To address this problem, the best option is consideration of more severe charges for those selling these dreadful products.

One reason behind it is that they will face fewer healthcare problems. Admitting of more medical or nursing students will lead the general public to gain a better quality of healthcare system. For example, had the government of India backed up medical students more, Indian people would have had a better level of well-being; but unfortunately, every year hundreds of medical graduates have to move their country into Western countries for finding better study opportunities.

As a prime example, in Los Angeles, immigration of villagers has caused many investors to spend their money and develop more Skyscrapers, and LA citizens have access to more equipped apartments. Furthermore, transportation has been improved dramatically.

Some individuals believe that the new chemicals used in agriculture have had numerous drawbacks on people's health. However, others, myself included, believe that the positive influences can surpass the negative consequences.\n\nOn the one hand, some people believe that chemical materials used for food are like a tip of an iceberg. One reason is that they can increase the risk of obesity. Hormones are the ones which are applied as fertilisers in vegetables or animal products, causing the users to become more overweight. For example, the rate of obesity has fundamentally grown among the U.S. citizens, who use the greatest amounts of non-organic foods in the world. These types of foods are considerably more economical than the organic ones, being used hugely by Americans, who are number one when it comes to the obesity rate. Another side effect is the risk of resistance. Using of these chemical materials, crops may defend less themselves against mutated pests. In particular, billions of tonnes of corn products were ruined in Canada in 2009 because of new species of these modified pests, reported by the National Geographic magazine.\n\nOn the other hand, I give a green light to the usage of these products because of having more advantages. One important benefit is that these fertilisers have increased the productivity of agricultural products. Clearly, the more they are used by farmers, the more massive crops are generated. As a prime example, we can see the quality of apple has been improved notably, compared to the past. The shape, volume, colour and even price of it have been changed positively, and many of citizens can afford it; therefore, even low-income families are able to purchase it. Furthermore, crops are nourished by more valuable items. In many farm industries, vitamins and minerals are added to crops, leading them to become far nutritious than the organic products. In particular, had not these chemicals been used in rice, more children would have suffered from Vitamin B deficiency, the most abundant vitamin being found in non-organic rice.\n\nIn conclusion, although consumption of chemical materials can be partly risky, I personally believe that their advantages can be greater than their negative side effects. These materials have helped humans to not only be able to afford better their food, but they can consume more healthy products than before.

While studying abroad appears to be an appealing option for many, it is argued that studying abroad does not come without a number of drawbacks.

Thus, they will learn to settle the problems by themselves while at the same time growing as an independent individual.

Completely banning cars in big cities is not a plausible solution as it is unrealistic, however, restricting the number of such private cars would be an effective solution indeed.\n\nNowadays, traffic contributed a lot in widespread of pollution. Car smoke, traffic jams and loud horns of vehicles are few reasons that significantly affect the environment and people in many ways. People are more vulnerable to various diseases and many have serious health issues due to pollution. In order to tackle this issues, restriction on private car ownership should be imposed. Not allowing people to drive their cars in big cities is not possible while it is much reasonable to restrict the number of cars a family can own, the number of minimum passenger on each car while driving would be the two pragmatic solutions.\n\nAdditionally, in order to combat with traffic congestion, new road infrastructure have been introduced by various nations that include deforestation to acquire more space to build new roads, modern bridges and pedestrian pathways. Those development works could destroy the natural habitat of various species that could lead towards the extinction of them from various countries.

The drastic increase in the urban population engenders a series of issues. Waste management is one of the key problems faced by almost all cities across the globe. Both the governments and citizens have to take effective steps to minimise the trash produced every day in these cities.\n\nFirstly, governments of all countries need to relocate the industries which leave behind a myriad of byproducts to the countryside, either by limiting the license in cities or by providing subsidies. In addition to that, public waste management committee has to be in place, which would regularly check how the thrash is managed by the industries. For example, a few states in India are encouraging industries to set up their plant in remote areas by providing free land. Thus a major problem of waste management can be resolved.\n\nSecondly, the government has to ensure that efficient waste disposal mechanism is connected to every household. Each house needs to have an easy access to litter bins and they must be cleaned by the public body 3 to 4 times every day. Moreover, if any citizen violates this law by throwing the garbage in the public area, he or she should be penalised heavily. In the case of Singapore, every apartment has waste disposal area and which is cleaned thrice a day by the government. This mechanism makes the management of rubbish organised.  \n\nCitizens should understand that they will ultimately face the problems if the garbage is not properly taken care of. They should take some responsibility to keep their living place and neighbourhood clean. In some cases, they should take the wastage to the waste disposal centre for recycling. Again, recycling and reusing products could be an effective way to tackle this issue. The country like Japan has been very successful in recycling and reusing the products and that had helped them to reduce the problem they had with the excessive wastage their citizens produce.  Recyclable products should be promoted so that rubbish creation can be minimised. Special concessions have to be given in supermarkets to promote customers to bring their own environment-friendly bags instead of polythene ones. This can be achieved by promoting the awareness sessions in the social media websites like Facebook and government advertisements in televisions. Usage of recyclable ensures that waste can be minimised.\n\nIn conclusion, the entire community has to take a lot of steps in tackling the waste management.

Across the globe, electricity and gas are used by almost every house to big industries. Although I believe that energy wastage should be minimised, I refute that we should simply cut down the use of energy for the essential purposes based on a timetable. The base for my views would be personal and professional.\n\nFrom a professional perspective, electricity and gas are an invaluable resource to run a simple gadget like computers to more complex machines like cranes. For instance, if we plan to switch off electricity at our work area once in a week, definitely a majority of the people will be idle, as most of the companies run based on computers. Moreover, if we try to save the energy when it is really needed, precious time of the employees working on electronic devices will be wasted. Therefore, it is essential to ensure that energy is available during the work hours. We should research and invest in producing better energy source rather than cutting the power for a day in a week. The world has become very competitive and imposing a restriction on the working hours in office would simply reduce the productivity of a country.\n\nFrom a personal point of view, energy is mandatory to charge personal gadgets like mobile phones to stay connected with the world. For example, if there is no power and the battery charge of the mobile phone is almost finishing, then the mobile will be turned off. In addition to that, a switched off smartphone not only cuts off phone calls but also disconnects from social media as there is no internet connectivity. Thus, it is obvious that electricity should not be cut off or reduced based on a time table. In most of the major cities gas is used for cooking, hence not using it for a day would mean that we would need to buy foods from restaurants or fast food shops which are not only expensive but also harmful for health.\n\nIn conclusion, by analysing how much essential is energy and gas in our day to day life, it is very much important that energy is available when required.

I believe that overpopulation and expenditure factors are two leading reasons for that, and some practical solutions should be implemented to tackle them.\n\nObviously, stress has been intensified globally due to two important reasons. The one is increasing the density of population globally. Birth rates have fundamentally grown, especially in cities, during last century, making more stressful situations to dwellers. For example, in India and China, their population have escalated far considerably since last three decades, reaching almost half of total world\u2019s population. As a result, inhabitants are annoyed more by traffic jams or noise pollution coming from vehicles. To reduce this growth, governments and organisations should consider more practical methods to slow the escalation of the population on Earth via popularising the contraceptive methods among couples or encouraging urban inhabitants to move and live in suburb areas.\n\n\nAnother reason is the enhancement of living spending. Individuals have to work longer hours than the past to be able to afford their regular expenses, including Internet bill, house mortgage or car lease; however, before people did not have to pay these bills. In addition, citizens used to paid more for their journeys than the past. Accessing to more low-cost airlines or resorts, individuals are motivated to spend more on them annually; therefore, they have to work longer hours and have more stressful lifestyles to pay them. To tackle this issue, the related authorities are better to consider more restrictions on workloads, which have been on of leading reasons for having a more anxious living condition.\n\n\nIn conclusion, anxiety has been raised notably. Inclining the density of population and growing of expenditures are two important reasons for that, and administrations should control them and subside people\u2019s stress.

This essay will analyse the both sides of view.\n\nTo begin with, as this is the age of science and technology and our planet requires more exposure to nature for making life more valid and convenient on it. This goal can only be achieved if we have sufficient scientists, astronomers and sea divers etc.\n\nFurther, students are the future of any nation.

This essay will discuss the advantages of spending holidays outside their homes.\n\nThe first advantage of spending holiday outside people\u2019s usual routine is that individuals will have new experiences and as a result, new positive emotions and feelings will emerge. For example, people can go to visit different countries such as France where they can visit Louvre or Eiffel Tower. There is no doubt that after visiting such places individuals will have an enormously positive energy for a long time.\n\n\nThe second benefit that needs to be taken into consideration is that people can meet different people whom they did not know before and have a great conversation. For example, when individual goes outside even near the river for a camping there is a greater chance of meeting new person rather than staying at home. Therefore, individuals can communicate to each other, share their food, exchange their life experience and stories. For this reason, holidays outside people\u2019s day-to-day routine can benefit persons in a much more positive way than spend holidays at home.\n\n\nTo sum up, it is evident that there are different ways of spending holidays but the best way is to go away from people\u2019s usual lifestyle.

For example, many western people wear casual clothing such as short pants or bikini, when they visit the sacred temple Tanah Lot in Bali. The local people feel distracted with these kinds of attitude and behaviour since tourists have been warned about the clothing standard but they have abandoned it.

With its impact in our lives for the recent years, some believe that it has given us a complicated life and others refute this because they believe that it has made life easier for us. These points view will be discussed in this order.\n\nIt is believed by some that new technology has made our lives too complicated because of the modern crimes we have heard these days. For instance, more electronic offences have being committed such as stalking and fraud offences. My elder brother, Fernando Meriales, who is a very busy engineer in Australia, is using an online bank because he thinks dealing his accounts online is way much easier than doing it traditionally to the bank. However, online money transactions have been committed by the fraud offenders using his bank account without his knowledge. In addition to this, social media crimes through the use of social networking sites such as Facebook and Instagram also emerged. An example is the San Roque High school girl student; Jessel Mallari has been fooled by her 30-years-old lover in Facebook and was raped by this criminal and taken her life. Thus, it is clear why some people gravitate towards this point of view.\n\nOn the other hand, many argue that modern technology has made our lives easier for the high-tech equipment and transportation facilities public people are using nowadays. For example, in the hospital where I am working, the Urdaneta Sacred Heart Hospital is using the Respiratory Ventilator for breathing support of our critically ill patients. Also, we do have a CT (Computed Topography) scan to diagnose easily those who have brain diseases. These two new technologies improve and prolong our patients' lives. Another example is the computer transportation system such as skyway and subway rail stations such in Singapore where through computers they can see who are the transport violators and ensures the public safety. After analysing these facts, it is clear why many people support this claim.\n\nIn conclusion, for reasons related to e-crimes and social crimes as well as high-tech facilities in medical and transportation field, the issue of whether technology has made our lives too complex or easier is refuted and supported by many.

Decision-making positions such as Prime Minister, Defence Minister, Defence Head, Chairman of Central Bank etc. are all associated with huge responsibilities and risks. A person in one of these positions should be mature and wise enough to make important decisions. There are few people who believe that young people should not be allowed to take responsibilities of these positions, while others feel contended that age cannot be a constraining factor for such positions. In this essay, we will discuss both of these two points of view and then present a well-critiqued opinion.\n\nFirstly, many people believe that young people are aggressive, impatient and less experienced. They can make a wrong decision which can be proved fatal for everyone. For example, it is often found the young people easily get carried away and try to resolve the issue with violence. On the other hand mature person often adopt a peaceful way to solve the matter. Thus considering the implication of the decision taken at a prime position is considered that young people are not suitable for these positions. They also think that without sufficient experience and capability of handling stress, those positions can\u2019t be served. Another point which is often prescribed by this group is that young people are sometimes driven by their emotion which is unsuitable for a responsible position.\n\nOn the other hand, many others feel that young people are more energetic, have fresh thinking and idea and they can drastically improve the nation\u2019s position. For instance, Akbar was just 12 years old when he was sworn as a king and was considered as one of the best emperors of Mughal era. The above example and qualities do lead us to establish a link between young people and the growth of a nation. Thus, young people are considered a good choice for top positions. The young owners of successful IT businesses also prove their ability to handle top positions like these. In the last 10 years, the world has witnessed many successful leaders and entrepreneurs that eliminate any doubt we have regarding the ability of young people.\n\nFollowing the above discussion, it is felt that younger people are quite capable of handling the responsibility associated with a top position.

I am strongly in accord with history here, and firmly believe that respect and safety of women are the basic foundations of a society. It is imperative that if a community is not providing equal rights to women and if women are bereft of basic freedom, there cannot be an ounce of progress in that society.\n\nTo buttress my point of view, I would like to strike comparisons between two countries: India and the USA. Although the constitution of India has legislated 33% of reservation for women, even after more than 50 years of independence, India has failed to respect its women. India is struggling to change the Male chauvinist mindset of its man brethren, who still consider themselves superior to women. The staggering rate of rape cases and nuisances against women is a reflection of this mindset. With these state of affairs for women, India has a long way to go to make its society an honourable place for women. In contrast to India, USA has done a very good job in terms of respecting its women, treating them as equal. The super power status of America can be equally attributed to the women in the USA who have equally contributed to the progress of the country.\n\nWoman of this world wears many hats at the same time.

For instance, in the last year's Olympic tally for India, Women won more medals than Man. It is thus apparent that to build a full blown progressive society, women plays a key role and thus must be respected in all manners.\n\nIn a nutshell, men and woman must be treated equally in the eyes of the society. Respect for women should be inculcated in the blood of a society. To make this world a better place to live, awareness should be spread to treat the woman with utmost reverence.

This in a way requires us to rely on others for our need. For instance, office executives mostly rely on laundry services, restaurants, house maids, cleaning services and so on to have their necessary works done. In the past, people used to do most of these tasks on their own. Moreover, the prices of education, house, daily commodities etc. is skyrocketing day by day and we need to rely on our parents to have those needs fulfilled until we get a job. When we will become earning members, our parents and children will rely on us.

The number of nuclear and single parent family proves that people are less reliant on others. We are free to pick the school, travel to other countries and make our choices for most of the major events in our life including picking our life partners. The progress of the technology has made us more self-reliant and we love to take advantages of the modern tools and devices to make things of our own. For instance, many people these days pick an online lesson than getting admitted to a training institute. Many of us even have the freedom to work from home and this is a paradigm shift in the way we earn our living. Finally, the gender equality and women empowerment movements have greatly made the women free from others reliance and self-dependent and this has all been possible only recently.\n\nIn conclusion, though some people think that modern era is the time when we are more reliant on each other, I personally believe that we are more free and self-reliant instead.

Firstly, as the number of senior people increase, the budget that governments must provide for the retirement fund and medical care automatically rise.

It is undeniable that many young teenagers are not yet ready to live independently by themselves. Many of these people are not yet matured in making decisions and in differentiating between right or wrong for them. As a consequence, many of the young people become addicted to narcotics and alcohol or became pregnant at a very young age.\n\n\nOn the other hand, despite the disadvantage, living independently at the young age has some advantages for them. Firstly, they will learn how to manage their own life and appreciate the time. They learn how to set some priorities in their life, as they have to make schedules for studying, groceries shopping, doing the laundry or cleaning their apartment by themselves. Secondly, for those who leave their parents for work, they would reduce the burden of their parents. Parents could stop the financial supports for their child and could be allocated for the younger children or for their retirement plan.\n\n\nIn conclusion, it is true that many young age people choose to live independently these days after they have graduated from high school.

The trend of indoor games such as video games is proliferating and gaining fame among all age groups \u2013 from adolescents to adults. However, the impact of this trend has come under scrutiny and has been a concern for many. The protagonists of such games cite that video games are effective educational tools, whereas dissenters void that claim by counting numerous demerits of such games. I too believe that video games are lethal trends and have negative repercussions. Some of the disadvantages will be outlined in following paragraphs.\n\nFirstly, while playing video games, players develop the sedentary position which is harmful to them ergonomically. Additionally, incessant exposure to game monitors could be detrimental to their vision. Other than physical impact, video games also impact emotional and social behaviour negatively, especially to children and adolescents. It can be noticed that the themes of a majority of the video games are prominently based on violent battle, massacre or destroying animal and mankind. Overindulgence to such games makes the young minds of children susceptible to emotional indifference. They could like to emulate the destroyers and warriors regarding them as role models.\n\n\nIn contrast, enthusiasts enumerate some credits to the account of video games. They believe that playing such games helps to improve your command on the technical gadgets. It is observed that good players are cognizant of the know-hows of computers and can monitor the game efficiently. Being good at the video game is a demand for the new generation. Many children complain that are marginalised in the school if they are not up-to-date with the video games, which leads to embarrassment for them.\n\nTo conclude, I would like to reiterate that video games have far more disastrous impacts that outweigh its positive sides.

Every country of the world is connected to each other and every individual has a role to play in the society. Some people think that one cannot help everyone in the society who is in need. Therefore, people should only show the concern to the inhabitants of his own country and community. I completely disagree with the statement for the following reason.\n\nFirstly, every nation today is interdependent on each other. Though, some nations are wealthier than others or require their basic needs for food, clothing and shelter to be fulfilled. According to me, countries that are well to do can help poorer countries to overcome their poverty. For example, some developing nations that had faced natural calamity require financial help to raise their economy. This is possible when another country is willing to do so. This not only provides support to affected country but also helps to develop international relationships and thus can enhance international trade. Furthermore, many countries like India face problems of unemployment. Other developed nations can resolve this problem by providing job opportunity to the immigrants. These can be achieved in their country to be served by some skilful individuals which, thereby, affects the economic development of the country.\n\nAbove all, we all are human beings and inhabitants of this wonderful planet, Earth. We all share the same biology. Therefore, it is needless to say that all should be helpful to each other. Humans make the world and humanity should make a better society.

This essay will discuss how the damage is caused, as well as the actions the Government and individuals can take to protect our world.\n\nThere are some ways in which people contaminate the environment. People worsen air pollution by making cars as their primary mode of transportation. After all, the more cars are driven, the more carbon dioxide is produced. Factories are also the main perpetrators of pollution by producing so much waste. In addition, there are individuals who dump rubbish in inappropriate places, such as the river. Unfortunately, their reckless actions make the river a toxic place to live for fish and other river inhabitants, eventually kill them.\n\nThe Government can solve environmental problems with a number of actions. One of them is to implement a pollution threshold for factories. If a company produces more pollution than the permitted threshold, it will be fined. Therefore, industrial companies would take necessary measures to reduce their waste. Another way is to improve public transportations. Reliable, clean, and safe mass transports will encourage people to use them, instead of using private cars.\n\nApart from the Government, individuals too can partake in protecting the environment. Firstly, individuals can reduce household waste. For instance, people can use cloth-made-bags instead of plastic-made-bags when shopping. After all, plastic can not be decomposed and its build up will harm the Earth. Secondly, people should use more public transportation and if possible, walk more. That way, pollution that comes from vehicles can be minimised.\n\nIn conclusion, people damage the environment with the high usage of private cars and industrial waste, and also by throwing rubbish irresponsibly. the Government can solve these problems by implementing waste limit and enhancing public transport system.

Many people are of the opinion that the role of university education is to merely facilitate a graduate's job hunting endeavours. Others believe that besides this, the beneficial ramifications a university can provide for its students are many.Firstly, it is obvious that the primal objective of any university is to award a successful candidate with a professional degree. Although a degree may not guarantee a job, it is, nevertheless necessary to have one, as employers would not want to hire an individual without the right kind of qualifications. Hence, if a university is able to increase job prospects of its graduates, people are naturally inclined to believe that this is the only task a university is supposed to fulfil.\n\nOn the other hand, many believe that a degree is just one of the many advantages a university can offer. Such as professional character development; the importance of which moves in tandem with that of a mere degree. Of course, both are important, but without the former, a graduate may not be able to earn a place for himself in a professional setting. The main reason the supports this claim is that employers seek not only the right qualifications of a potential employee but also how well he or she can adapt to the work environment of that particular firm.\n\nHaving analysed both views, it seems that besides helping the graduates to find better jobs, a university can do much more than that, such as instilling professional attitudes in the graduates that can facilitate not only their job prospects but also make them contribute towards the welfare of the overall society.

How could it be tackled?", "extra_topic": "", "model_answer": "\nOver the last few years, obesity has become a serious problem. These days, it affects an increasing number of both children and adults. Causes of overweight must be considered and addressed effectively; otherwise, societies will suffer from even greater health problems. This essay will look at the causes of this problem and make some suggestions about how to tackle it.\n\nOne of the main causes of overweight is the high intake of junk food such as hamburgers, chips, and fried chicken. Many people prefer to have a takeaway meal or pick up a pre-prepared food in the supermarket, which contain high salt and fat, rather than cooking a healthy meal at home. For instance, in the UK, sales of junk food have risen significantly over the last few years. The solution is for the government to increase sales tax on any food that is considered to be unhealthy. This would make consumers decrease their intake of this type of food and start to make the healthy home-made one. People lack the knowledge of food ingredients and their health issues and thus do not make informed decisions while talking foods. Easy access to private cars has reduced the walking and cycling habit of people. The quality and ingredients of quick foods/ fast foods are not strictly monitored by the authority.\n\nAnother problem is that fewer and fewer persons are doing sports. This is because of the high expenses of registration in a gym. For example, the monthly fees of gyms in the UK are around 40 or 50 pounds, which is very difficult to be afforded by many. To address this, the government could assign more money for sports facilities such as gyms to become more affordable. So that many persons would hopefully do sports and consequently start to lose weight.\n\nA third cause of the problem is the sedentary lifestyle many families are living all the time. The high quality of life and having many facilities make our lifestyle lazier. Many families have more than one car and they are using all the cars all the time to go to their destinations, even if it can be reached by bus or on foot. The way forward might be for the government to increase the price of oil and charge owners of private cars for road use. This would make people go to their destinations on foot or by bicycles instead of using their cars.\n\nTo sum up, obesity becomes an increasingly worrying issue affecting a wide range of age groups. In my view, government, parents and school all have a role to play in tackling the problem. Action must be taken urgently; otherwise, our country will face even more serious problems in health.

In the most developed nations children in the name of freedom of expression do not listen to their parents and leave them and ultimately the whole family suffers.

Young people these days have passions for numerous sports but hardly participate in outdoor sports.

All these different characteristics enable them to do different tasks according to their affinities. Due to this, some people opine that it would be best for both sexes to involve themselves in those tasks which suit their personality and skill sets. Others, however, think that both are equal and can do each other\u2019s job as efficiently as they can do their own. Therefore, let us analyse the task from both perspectives in order to reach to a relevant conclusion.\n\nTo begin with, it can be said that both males and females have an individual set of characteristics, which enables them to perform well in certain tasks. For example, women are considered exceptionally good at taking care of the household activities and bringing up the children. As most of the women are kind, loving and caring by nature, they are best suited for this job. What is more, they are also seen as worthy of the job of taking care of household activities due to their creativity and organisational skills. Similarly, men also have some special traits attached with their personality. For instance, men are deemed to be strong, confident and decisive. These qualities make it possible for them to give excellent performance in areas such as earning bread and butter for the home and making decisions for the family. Apart from that, they can also support their families in emotional as well as security matters.\n\n\nHowever, even though both genders are best suited for the jobs mentioned above, we cannot ignore the changing trends, which are taking place in modern world. Nowadays, with the spread of education and equal rights, more and more women are breaking the barriers of their home in order to work outside. They can be seen placed at several important positions, from doctors to politicians and they are also performing better than the expectations of most of the people. In the same way, men are also indulging themselves in household tasks by looking after their children and doing household chores. Therefore, it cannot be said that both of the genders are best suitable to do only one type of work.\n\n\nWomen are performing well in professions like teaching, nursing, marketing and those kinds of jobs suits their natural talents and skills. On the other hand, men can work in a crowd and in places where physical labour is required.\n\nIn the ultimate analysis, it can be said that both men and women have been separated with individual qualities facilitating them with abilities to do several tasks.

For verification, it is illustrated that the students who are well recognised with internet usage in school time, do not usually face the inconvenience in further life.\n\nOn the contrary, in spite of the internet being such helpful in school, its drawbacks cannot be overlooked. It is likely that the pupils can be overdependent on the internet. It can swallow the direct interaction between students and teacher. For instance, there are many websites on the internet with which students can attend any lecture of his class through the internet while sitting at home. So he or she probably make it a habit and as to he or she can give preference to the online methods of study.

In this essay, I will look at both sides of the argument and give my opinion.First and foremost, many believe that any child can be a genius one. It is only about how much his parents are paying attention to his needs and what do they do to develop these hobbies. For example, a psychology professor agreed with his wife to raise their children as the books of development and psychology say, and now their daughter is the second best chess player in the world.", "original_link": "https://www.ielts-mentor.com/writing-sample/writing-task-2/1143-it-is-believed-some-people-are-born-with-certain-talents"}, {"essay_topic": "In many cities crime is increasing.

The sad fact is that crime rate is increasing including killing, stealing, robbing, kidnapping, rape\u2026 etc. Actually, there are many reasons for that awful and miserable phenomenon.Some people always look at other peoples' properties and not pleased with what they have. And that, of course, leads to hatred and then lead to misdeeds. Moreover, some people are psychiatric disordered and which in turn leads to violence. Another thing that we should take care of is the lack of necessary money; many criminals would not have become criminals if they had had enough money and other daily needs for themselves and their families. In a recent study about crimes and their reasons, professor Kathy Mac James said that 85% gangsters joined gangs due to the shortage of social welfare. She protested that this majority of gangsters were either orphan who didn't get enough care during childhood and adolescence or not married. Now it is the time to raise an important question: \u2018do all the previous reasons give you the right to be a criminal? The answer comes immediately: of course not, even if you don't have a cent in your pocket.\n\nAnother important question is: What is the solution of this heinous situation? How can we overcome crime in our society? In my opinion, it's the responsibility of both the government and individuals.

This essay deals with it and gives my point of view.\n\nVisitors should respect the local customs, demeanours and cultures of the host country. If the guests behave abusively to the emcee, it is not the polite way in our society. Before going somewhere, it is better to know the local traditions of a definite country. Every country does have the same customs, cultures, behaviours and origins. If an individual follows the local customs of others in its respective places, it means mutual understanding to each other. If so, people on the earth will raise the esteem on one another and every country will reach a compromise, then the world will become the improving, beautiful and peaceful place ever to live in without wars.\n\nAs an example, many leaders from the world visit Myanmar and they recognise mutual respects and show affection to others such as saying \u2018mingalarpar\u2019, making a gesture of respect by putting the palms together and raising them to the forehead. They also value the religious customs by taking off their shoes and wearing the appropriate dresses on the flat ground around the stupa and pagodas. Too many local residents warmly welcome them gladly and heartily. The ignorance of local language and custom may lead to a big problem since it is disrespectful to another culture.\n\nFor another example, when I was travelling to Saudi Arabia as a visitor, I wore \u2018abaya\u2019 and covered my long hairs for going outside. This meant just paying respect for other culture and I did not lose my original identity.

Many countries have imposed stricter laws in order to restrain its usage. Such an action is the prohibition of smoking in public places. According to some, this ban can help us to lessen the usage of cigarettes to a considerable degree and therefore is advocated to be implemented everywhere in the world. While others believe it to be a restriction imposed on one's rights. Therefore, let us analyse the task at hand more deeply.\n\nIt is irrefutable to say that smoking is injurious to health and need to be contained up to a certain limit. Many adverse effects are attached along with its usage in public places. First of all, it will set a bad example for the adolescents. Promoting the smoking in common places can lead the younger generations to follow the same path. And there is no doubt in that the future of the country lies in the hands of coming generations. Therefore, it would be unwise to compromise it. Secondly, the amount of litter created by this practice can lead to an incline in the garbage, which further increases the burden of government. As they have to spend more money on the cleanliness of cities. Finally, it can cause conflicts among people who are not ready to compromise their own health by inhaling the second-hand smoke. This is indeed justified as the recent studies have shown that passive smoking is as bad as normal smoking, if not worse.\n\nOn the other hand, those who do not support this idea have their own reasons. The first and foremost is that those people believe that this rule will cause the demise of many businesses. They think that if it is not allowed to smoke cigarettes in public places such as bars and restaurants, then people will stop coming to such places and those businesses will have to entail losses. What is more, according to them, it will also result in unemployment. As decreased usage of cigarettes means lesser sales which in result can render many workers out of jobs. Finally, it is also seen as a valuable source of generating revenues for the government and if this rule is to be put into action, then a big portion of that income will be taken away from the government, which it levies in the form of taxes.\n\nTo conclude, it can be said that allowing doing such a practice in places with people is not advisable. Therefore, a complete ban should be put into exercise for making the experience of visiting such places pleasant.[Written by - Iqbal Singh]", "original_link": "https://www.ielts-mentor.com/writing-sample/writing-task-2/1131-ielts-writing-task-2-sample-223-in-some-countries-it-has-been-made-illegal-for-people-to-smoke-in-all-public-places"}, {"essay_topic": "These days many people leave their country to work abroad and take their family with them.", "extra_topic": "", "model_answer": "\nNowadays, many people migrate to other countries to work, and in many cases, they take their family members with them as well.

Many parents are of the opinion that it will be beneficial to the students when they work for a charity and improving the neighbourhood, just to name some examples. Personally, I am convinced that community service should be part of high school programmes for several reasons.There are a handful of advantages that community service brings to the youngsters. To begin, it helps the teenagers to develop an excellent interpersonal skill. Admittedly, it is more valuable to do the unpaid social work than staying at home playing with electronic devices. It provides teenagers with an avenue to socialise with others, encourage them to exchange their thoughts with people of the same interest. It is indirectly helping them to develop the crucial socialising skill which plays an indispensable role in their studies and their prospective job. They will be benefited by learning how to communicate with people around us and respect other's opinions. In short, community service will benefit the students by giving them an opportunity to meet new friends and thus widen their friend cycle.\n\nApart from that, teenagers will be more patient and have higher endurance after working for the community service. To illustrate, when they teach the younger children about sports, they are actually learning the value of being more patient which cannot be learnt from textbooks. To pick up this good value, it can only be acquired through practising. On the other hand, teaching children about sports is proven to be an effective way of destressing. In the twenty-first century, even citizen including student is becoming more stressful than in the past. Thus, they can keep their mind off from their studies when doing something not related to their academic studies like community service. To put in a nutshell, community service can educate the youngsters to be more patient which is essential in dealing with troubles.\n\nIn conclusion, I think that community service should be implemented in the high school programmes as there are numerous advantages of carrying out community service.

As a result of this, learning a foreign language at an early age has become a controversial issue in the global village. Some experts claim that primary school is the best place for learning another language instead of secondary school. I firmly believe that there is a defensible basis for this argument.\n\nThe proponents of this view discuss that there are many reasons behind of their claims. The most important one is about recent research. The studies have shown that the children between 4-9 ages have a great opportunity to learn new languages. Also, they clarify their claims by an example, a survey among 200 pupils, has shown that the above mention ages have a crucial role in children building character and developing their personality. Moreover, give the special care and settle down proper curriculum could be much beneficial for them in this way. Consequently, because of carefree mind children can catch more points in this level.\n\n\nIn parallel, I personally side with this idea. The key point to justify this attitude could be illustrated by a personal tangible example. A couple of years ago, I met a German family with an interesting story. To cut the long story short, Lucas, the first child of the family, has started learning the English language at secondary school and now the level of his English skill is almost intermediate. Conversely, his sister has started English and France together at primary school. Now, she can speak very fluently both of them. On balance, beyond a shadow of a doubt, the primary school can pave the way for learning a foreign language easily. Although, it should be considered that the method and atmosphere of the school play a key role in learning.\n\nAll in all, we should own up to the fact that learning a foreign language has become a key factor in our lifelong. It goes without saying, having a strong basis in a new language can uplift us towards prosperity. Primary schools are the best places to enhance our children's language ability.

Why?", "model_answer": "\nThroughout the human life, people will always be in special circumstances. They should make an important decision like choosing their life partners or a convenient major for their future. Today the books are proper resources of knowledge, which can play a significant role to inform people in almost all fields. However, in my opinion, books cannot be useful for personal stuff as well as personal experience, because of some reasons, which are elucidated below.\n\nFirst of all, although books are a suitable resource and let us know about others' experiences, it cannot be helpful in personal problems. As it has known to everybody, the attitude of one person is totally different from another one. For example, two people in the same situation make two dissimilar decisions. As a result, the experiences which are gathered from books cannot be constructive for people to cope with their troubles.\n\nFurthermore, personal experiences are more deeply and penetrate into our subconscious, since we were in the situation and we felt all of the things that happened to us. It is more influential than just reading them in the books. Recently, researchers have depicted that human always learn everything better when they observe them with their eyes or touch them. For instance, the students who had been taught in a laboratory got better marks in their exam than those who had taught verbally.\n\nIn conclusion, I personally think, the influences of books are superficial. When we go through the problems which we read exactly the same one on the book before, we usually perform our instructions rather than doing what authors said. On the contrary, personal experiences have a profound impact on our decisions which we will make in the future.(Approximately 285 words)", "original_link": "https://www.ielts-mentor.com/writing-sample/writing-task-2/437-knowledge-gained-from-experience-or-the-knowledge-gained-from-books"}, {"essay_topic": "It is often said that the subjects taught in schools are too academic in orientation and that it would be more useful for children to learn about practical matters such as home management, work and interpersonal skills.", "extra_topic": "", "model_answer": "\nA criticism often heard these days is that the subjects taught in schools tend to be too academic and contribute little to preparing a young person for the real-life tasks he or she will have to perform after graduation. They say that academic subjects are rooted in the past, and are not useful for solving modern problems. I disagree with this point of view for three reasons.My first reason is that it is the duty of parents, not teachers, to prepare their children to deal with the practical affairs of life. The home, not the classroom, is the ideal place to learn about home management and interpersonal skills. As for work abilities and attitudes, they are best learned \u201con the job\u201d and under the supervision of an experienced older worker.", "original_link": "https://www.ielts-mentor.com/writing-sample/writing-task-2/436-subjects-taught-in-schools-are-too-academic"}, {"essay_topic": "In some countries, the average worker is obliged to retire at the age of 50, while in others people can work until they are 65 or 70. Meanwhile, we see some politicians enjoying power well into their eighties. Clearly, there is little agreement on an appropriate retirement age. Until what age do you think people should be encouraged to remain in paid employment?", "extra_topic": "", "model_answer": "\nMandatory retirement age varies from society to society, perhaps a reflection of economics, population pressures or simply value systems. Indeed, retirement at 50 can probably be as easily justified as that at 70. It is my belief, however, that the longer an able person is allowed to work, the better for both the individual worker and the employer.\n \nChronological age is not always a true indicator of ability. While some 65-year-olds may not perform as well as they did in their past, many workers at this age do just as well or better than they used to. People's suitability for a position should be a reflection of their performance in the job, rather than the number of wrinkles or grey hairs they have. Employers concerned about the increasing age of their employees need only observe their work records. Those doing poorly may be asked to retire, but those as yet unaffected by age should stay on. Indeed, it would appear economical for an organisation to retain its older employees when possible rather than spend time and money on training new workers.\n\n \nRemaining in one's job for as long as one is able makes sense as life expectancies increase around the world. As people live longer, they are longer able to contribute to society in the form of meaningful work. But they are also in need of income for a longer period, so a mandatory retirement age of 55 for someone who is statistically likely to live to 77 becomes increasingly difficult to justify. At a time when populations are ageing, governments are less able to provide for their senior citizens, so by keeping able workers in paid employment for as long as is practicable, public expenditures are less strained.\n \nThus, workers who can still demonstrate their capacity to carry out their work should not be asked to retire simply because they have reached a certain age. Societies that insist on early retirement may do well to look again at their policies.(Approximately 333 words)", "original_link": "https://www.ielts-mentor.com/writing-sample/writing-task-2/435-ielts-writing-task-2-sample-209-until-what-age-do-you-think-people-should-be-encouraged-to-remain-in-paid-employment"}, {"essay_topic": "Popular events like the football World Cup and other international sporting occasions are essential in easing international tensions and releasing patriotic emotions in a safe way.", "extra_topic": "", "model_answer": "\nEvery four years, the whole world stops to watch international sporting events such as the Olympics and the Football World Cup in which athletes show their best performance to make their country proud of them. These sporting occasions have proved to be helpful in easing international tensions in difficult times when powerful leaders were trying to control the world's economy and other governments were fighting over land.\n\nThe Olympic Games are one of the best examples which prove how sporting events can bring nations together, at least temporarily. From ancient History, when Greeks and Romans would interrupt battles to participate in the games, to the more recent international disputes, when athletes from Palestine and Israel would forget their differences, compete pacifically and even embrace each other after an event. Moreover, these popular events have called the world's attention to the terrible consequences of wars; thus some leaders have tried to accept agreements to end their dispute and live peacefully. Again when Pakistan and India play cricket against each other, it, at least, temporarily helps the citizen of both countries forget about the war among these two countries. When Pakistani famous cricketers do stage programs with Indian popular crickets, then only friendship and peace can be felt, not the war and political conflicts.  \n\nSimilarly, international sporting events show benefits in some developing countries which live in a daily internal civil war. For example, Brazil has a high rate of unemployment, lack of education, hunger, crime, poverty and corruption which leads to an immense embarrassment of being Brazilian and a low self-esteem. However, when the Football World Cup starts, the Brazilian squad, which is considered the best team in the world, provokes an amazing feeling of pride in their country. Most people seem to forget all their problems and even the criminal activity decreases. They paint roads with the national colours, use wear the Brazilian team shirt and buy national flags. Moreover, the competition brings families and neighbours together and even rival gangs watch the games and celebrate peacefully.\n\nIn conclusion, popular sporting events play an important role in decreasing international tensions and liberating patriotic feelings as History has shown.(This model answer has been prepared by the site developer.

But while the overseas study has its drawbacks, the difficulties are far outweighed by the advantages. Indeed, people who go abroad for study open themselves up to experiences that those who stay at home will never have.\n\nThe most obvious advantage to overseas university study is the real-life use of a different language. While a person can study a foreign language in his or her own country, it cannot compare with the constant use of the language in academic and everyday life. There is no better opportunity to improve second-language skills than living in the country in which it is spoken. Moreover, having used the language during one's studies offers a distinct advantage when one is applying for jobs back home that require the language.\n\nOn a university campus, the foreign student is not alone in having come from far away. He or she will likely encounter many others from overseas and it is possible to make friends from all around the world. This is not only exciting on a social level but could lead to important overseas contacts in later professional life. Finally, living and studying abroad offers one a new and different perspective of the world and, perhaps most important, of one's own country. Once beyond the initial shock of being in a new culture, the student slowly begins to get a meaningful understanding of the host society. On returning home, one inevitably sees one's own country in a new, often more appreciative, light.\n\nIn conclusion, while any anxiety about going overseas for university study is certainly understandable, it is important to remember that the benefits offered by the experience make it well worthwhile.(This model answer has been prepared by the site developer.

As economies grow and access to cars spreads to increasing numbers of people, this trend is likely to worsen. The solution, it would seem, is for the government to encourage the use of public transport in urban areas, thus decreasing dependence on the car.\n\nOne way to stimulate public transport use is to make private car use more expensive and inconvenient. The introduction of tolls along urban motorways has been successfully employed in many cities. Other such measures are high-priced permits for parking in urban areas and the restriction of parking to a limited number of cars. Faced with high costs or no place to park, commuters would perhaps be more willing to abandon their cars in favour of buses or trains.\n\nThere are also less punishing ways of spurring public transport use. The construction of free car-parks at suburban train stations has proven successful in quite a number of countries. This allows commuters to drive part of the way but then they ultimately use public transportation into the central, most congested, urban areas.\n\nMoreover, private cars can not carry many passengers at a time yet occupy spaces in the street. As the number of cars is increasing in the road so does the traffic jam. Perhaps the major disadvantage of cars, in general, is the huge damage they do to the human health and to the environment. More cars mean more pollution. The environment pollution is a serious issue today and at any cost, we must reduce the amount of pollution.\n\nIndeed, making public transport more comfortable and convenient should work to attract more commuters and decrease traffic congestion.

Reading is essential for children. It extends their range of interests, improves their imagination and helps them gain more knowledge and experience through books.

It was really a terrible experience because I did not need my alarm clock to awake anymore. I was awake exactly in a few seconds after my neighbour began to smoke.From my point of view, the ideal neighbour must always be ready to offer help.

In the following paragraphs, I will give some basic reasons why I think that way.I am a former student and I know all advantages that can be given by libraries. First for all, it is the cheapest way to prepare for the incoming lecture, to do the homework, to make a research and just to read some books. From my point of view, it is very important to supply the libraries with the new books, magazines, journals and newspaper. Second of all, libraries are the places where students can spend a few hours reading between lectures if their schedule does not allow them to go home. So, libraries must be light and large enough, have comfortable chairs and tables. A third reason, why a good library is so significant for a student is that it is a free access to computers and the Internet. If a student can not allow to buy himself a computer or an access to the Internet he can use it there. I like libraries because it is a good place to meet and communicate with each other, surf the Internet looking for the last news, read some books that you do not want to buy and just relax to the accompaniment of the pages.", "original_link": "https://www.ielts-mentor.com/writing-sample/writing-task-2/416-ielts-writing-task-2-sample-190-universities-should-give-the-same-amount-of-money-to-their-students-sports-activities"}, {"essay_topic": "Some high schools require all students to wear school uniforms.

Both policies have their own positive points, but I personally think that it is better for high school students to wear uniforms.To begin with, it is common that some high schools do not require their students to wear uniforms. They believe that uniforms should not be the main concern of education, and schools should focus more on the curriculum quality and learning process than focusing on dresses.

Do you think this is a good rule or a bad rule?", "extra_topic": "", "model_answer": " (Agreement - This is a good rule)\nThere is no scope for any doubt that \"Smoking is injurious to health \". Taking this fact into consideration, many countries have taken actions of strictly prohibiting smoking in public places. I strongly feel that this is a good move to reduce smoking and keeping the environment safe, even though many smokers are strongly against this move.\n\nFirst of all, smoking not only affects the health condition of the smokers but also of the nonsmokers by a process called passive smoking. In fact, it is a scientifically proven fact that passive smokers get more health hazards compared to the smokers. Various diseases like asthma, lung cancer, pneumonia, heart and valve ailments are found common among such individuals. This is why, to improve the public health and to prevent dangerous diseases, banning smoking in public places and in office buildings is an effective move.\n\nSecondly, smoking in public places like schools, parks, shopping complexes, beaches, offices etc. tend to develop a strong desire among young generation to inculcate this habit. To nurture a healthy young generation, we should support the idea that public smoking should be banned.\n\nFinally, by discouraging smoking in outdoor areas, the smokers can be gradually forced to quit their habit or can reduce the number of cigarettes being smoked. Considering this I feel that banning public smoking is a good rule and all countries should adopt this policy.\n\nIn conclusion, I strongly recommend that all countries should put forward this rule for the health and well-being of their public. Even the smoking zones that are already placed in some of the public places should also be banned completely.\n\n[ Written by - Tintu]Model Answer 2: (Agreement - This is a good rule)\nThe question about whether people should be allowed to smoke in public places is the one that is open for debate. All people can be divided into two groups- smokers and non-smokers. Smokers agree that they do not benefit the society by smoking, but think that they should have some special places in office buildings or public places where they can smoke. However, others believe that smokers should not be allowed to smoke in any places except their own apartments. Personally, I completely agree with the last opinion. For the following reasons, which I will mention bellow, I think that smokers should not contaminate the air other people breathe.", "original_link": "https://www.ielts-mentor.com/writing-sample/writing-task-2/414-ielts-writing-task-2-sample-188-people-are-no-longer-allowed-to-smoke-in-many-public-places"}, {"essay_topic": "Many students have to live with roommates while going to school or university. What are some of the important qualities of a good roommate?", "extra_topic": "", "model_answer": "\nEvery student, during some parts of their education, especially while doing professional courses, has to stay away from home and live in a hostel accommodation. During this period, they share their rooms with other students. Roommates with certain qualities become ideal and others expect to have such roommates. In my opinion, a good roommate should be kind, understanding, open-minded, and free from any bad habit that would disturb the other members of the room.\n\nFirst and foremost, a good roommate should be kind and generous. He or she should be able to help the roommate when needed in their studies and give them mental support. There should not be any unnecessary fights or arguments. Moreover, he or she has to be understanding and friendly.\n\nSecondly, that person should not be selfish. As they live together, there should be an open-mindedness to share the facilities available equally between the two. For example, the time for using the bathroom, usage of night lamp for studies and so on.\n\nLastly, a nice roommate should be free of any bad habits like smoking, gambling and drinking. It is quite often the fact that roommates with bad habit can influence others very fast since students spend most of the time with them and finally end up taking these habits to themselves. This, in turn, can have a very bad impact on their health, studies and characters.\n\nIn conclusion, having a good roommate is essential for our professional and personal growth and as a roommate, we should also possess those qualities.[Written by Tintu]", "original_link": "https://www.ielts-mentor.com/writing-sample/writing-task-2/413-ielts-writing-task-2-sample-187-what-are-some-of-the-important-qualities-of-a-good-roommate"}, {"essay_topic": "In your country, is there more need for land to be left in its natural condition or is there more need for land to be developed for housing and industry?", "extra_topic": "", "model_answer": "\nI am from Saint Petersburg, Russia, and I think that the question about whether lands should be left in their natural condition or should be utilised to be developed for housing and industry is the one that is open for debate. Personally, I believe that it is a controversial question because both views have their advantages. However, in this situation, an intermediate position can be taken. In the following paragraphs, I will give my reasons to support the answer.\n\nFrom the one side, saving land in its natural condition brings many benefits. First of all, many wild animals will thrive in our forests. Unfortunately, nowadays many wild animals are endangered because they do not have any place to live in and enough food to eat. Second of all, our children will be able to learn about animals not only from books but also from observing them in their natural environment. In addition to those benefits, our air will be cleaner because many forests will clean it from pollution and make it fresher.\n\nFrom the other side, deforesting our land and building many new constructions can have a few positive aspects. For example, building new industrial buildings may have a positive impact on the country's economy. Many new companies will have the opportunity to produce more goods and as the result of this the country will receive more money from abroad and this will lead to the improvement of the economy on the whole.\n\nTo conclude, all mentioned above, I think that we need to be more careful with the natural resources we consume and, moreover, we can do something to preserve them. For example, companies that produce lumber can also resume the resources of wood by planting new trees there. This way we can preserve our land and save it from defrosting. I must agree that it is difficult for Russia at this moment not to develop land for housing and industry because the country needs money and a stronger economy, but I believe that many new factories can replace the old ones without developing new land. So, my point is that we must extend the production of new goods but not at the expense of the wild animals and their land.

In the following paragraphs, I will analyse these problems and make suggestions about how a school can help a student in this situation.The first difficulty I had to face in a new school was a huge amount of new people such as teachers and classmates, who have no idea who I am. It was easy with the teachers, I usually stayed after the class, introduced myself to him or her and asked about their curriculum. However, with my new classmates, it was a little more difficult. I had to stand up for myself a few times because this is the way students get to know each other. However, I believe that there is a better way to get to know each other.

One such policy suggested by some is that teachers' payment should be based on the scale of students' learning. This might sound an alluring idea, but I personally disagree with it.\n\nTo begin with, theoretically, the policy of paying a teacher based on how much his students actually learn is quite a good one. But the practical aspect is quite different as it is almost impossible to accurately judge the level of students learning curve taught by a teacher. For instance, some students perform quite brilliantly in a class while others even fail to grasp the basic concepts. This can be seen even in a single classroom where the same teachers are teaching those students. Moreover, this policy would create an outburst and dissatisfaction among the teachers and would actually decline their motivation. Not to mention, this would actually decline the education and teaching quality which is not at all desirable.  \n\nAnother key thing to remember is that teaching profession is already failing to attract talented individuals as they opt to more attractive salary offered by other professions. If payment based on students learning curve is considered, it would make it an even less attractive profession. On contrary to this policy, more training, motivations, monitoring teaching styles of teachers and then counselling, student feedback on teachers could be better alternatives.\n\nTo conclude, teachers' role, in a country, is very important and no policy that might be detrimental for their motivation or for the educational setup should be launched.

At old times people did not depend on information that much. They did not have to fill out many application forms, write a lot, read news from a newspaper about an economic situation, etc. Now the situation has changed. Knowledge and the ability to analyse information are more important now than man's physical strength.\n\nFirst of all, it is essential for a person to be literate in Informational Age. Every day one needs to withdraw money from cash machines, to pay a bill, to write out a check, to fill some forms, to read instructions, ads, job requirements and applications. It is almost impossible to survive in modern society without these basic abilities. Almost every job requires these important skills. Imagine that one does not have them and one has a family to care about. So, one's first step is to find a job. One can do it either through newspapers or by asking help from one's friends. One can not read, so one chooses the second way. The second step is to pass a job interview and fill out some forms. Moreover, one has to sign a job contract - an important document that concludes all one's rights and terms. So, basically, it is almost impossible to get a job for a literate person in the modern world, especially in developed countries.\n\nSecond of all, the number of jobs that do not require the ability to read and write, is dramatically decreasing. Almost every employer wants to have an employee with basic communication and computer skills. In fact, more jobs on the labour market are for literate persons. A lot of primitive jobs are done by machines nowadays.

Students will have the opportunity to choose the best teachers because if a teacher gets a low grade he or she may be fired and replaced with the better one.\n\nFinally, the quality of education will increase dramatically. Students will be getting more interesting and professional lectures. Also, they will constantly attend classes in order to listen to an amazing lecture and make an evaluation of the current teacher. In addition to those practical benefits, a school will be better funded by it is sponsors and appreciated in the community. This, in its turn, will attract more students because it will be an honour to study in such a school.\n\nTo sum up, I think that evaluation of teachers by their students will bring many benefits and allow students as well as teachers to gain more knowledge and experience.", "original_link": "https://www.ielts-mentor.com/writing-sample/writing-task-2/397-ielts-writing-task-2-sample-171-schools-should-ask-students-to-evaluate-their-teachers"}, {"essay_topic": "It is more important for students to study history and literature than it is for them to study science and mathematics.", "extra_topic": "", "model_answer": "\nMany people believe that students should give more attention to the subjects of history and literature rather than mathematic or science. I personally disagree with the statement, as I believe that all subjects that are taught in school are important and the following paragraphs will explain some of the reasons in details.\n\nFirstly, it is a fact that all subjects that are delivered at school are important. All the subjects that are thought in school will be useful for students when they grow up, even though each student will be a specialised in some specific subject. For example, although a student might become a history teacher in the future, it is essential for him/ her to learn about mathematic and economics as well. Since as a teacher, he/ she will be given other tasks besides tutoring such as preparing the expenditure budget of his class for one year and that require some accounting and calculation skills.\n\nSecondly, it is obvious that all individuals have their own different talent. Some students may have a personal interest in studying in English literature while others might have the passion in learning physical science. And if the school only focus on studying two or three particular subjects such as literature or history, then it would be unfair for students who have the passion in mathematic or science.  \n\nIn conclusion, I do not agree that school should emphasise more on the subjects of history and literature than mathematics or science. I do believe that schools should teach each of the subjects proportionately since all of the subjects are beneficial for the students.

I think that money donation for environment protection must take priority over the support of the arts. Bellow, I will give my reasons to support my answer.\n\nThe invention of the automobile is undoubtedly one of the humankind's greatest inventions. However, the automobile brought us many disadvantages as well. The air nowadays is polluted by millions of cars every day. Every day clouds of exhaust are rising from the ground contaminating all around. So, I think that money from a company can be used to make our air fresher and cleaner.\n\nAnother important aspect of this is the contamination of water. Water is an essential resource for all living creatures. Nothing will survive without it. Unfortunately, we spend fresh water sometimes very carelessly. Also, many factories wash away their used resources in the nearest river poisoning everything alive there. I think that monetary donations would be helpful for cleaning our water resources from oil, garbage and chemical matters.\n\nFinally, I think that now humankind faced the problem of overpopulation.

Risk takers are smart and innovative people as they have creative ideas and planning and they dare to take chances.

Some people think that the government should spend more money on developing streets and highways, while others believe that improving public transportations is the most important one. The following essay will discuss in details about it, but I do believe that both aspects are important and should be proportionately improved.\n\nOn the one hand, a group of people think that the government should focus on improving their street, road and highway facilities. They believe that public accesses are vital for the economic development of the respective country. Without the existence of qualified roads and highways, it will be difficult for industries to grow, as there will be some obstacles for the supply of raw materials and deliveries of goods. Consequently, it will impact on the efficiency of many companies and also to the government's income tax.On the other hand, other people think governments should spend more budgets on improving and maintaining public transportation such as buses, trains, aeroplanes and ferries. They believe that if the government could improve the quality of these mass transportation facilities, it will reduce traffic and air pollution problems. As public transportations become more convenient and safe, more people will use them, and it will gradually reduce the number of private vehicle users. As a consequent, it will reduce traffic congestion and reduce air pollution as well.\n\nIn conclusion, I personally believe that the government's spending on public accesses and transportations are both essentials.

I will through light on the importance of these groups in the following paragraphs.\n\nPublic groups or associations engage in solving problems in society or in a community. Let us take the case of Lions club of our community, it is a public group which takes care of about general issues related to water supply, roads and security of our locality. The members of this group are senior citizens, retired people from work and they are volunteers. Last year this club had done an excellent job in protecting our locality from chemical pollution by blocking the establishment of chemical industry near to our residential area. This club collected votes from the people against the company establishment and addressed the government to abolish the permission. Such groups are important for society improvement. Next, there are private groups which are formed only for member's benefits.\n\nPrivate groups belong to a sector or domain. To illustrate such as, I am a member of TIBCO technology group, this is formed by people who work on TIBCO software. There 400 members in this group from various organisations, we share knowledge related to our technology, job openings in our technology and we provide job reference to group members.

However, others think that it is inappropriate and the government should spend more money on food and shelters for poor people, medicine, education, etc. These two options are very different and controversial. But I think that developing computer technology brings people more advantages than they think it does.\n\nFirst of all, humankind nowadays more and more depends on computers. We often do not suspect the presence of computers around us. For example, when we withdraw money from cash machines, get some gasoline on the gas station and pay with our credit cards in the stores. So, nowadays computer technology plays an essential role in our everyday life. Second, computer technology brings more job opportunities. For a country, the computer technology means power, knowledge and constant development. In addition to those practical benefits, the development of computer technology brings a lot of money to the country.\n\nFrom the other side, the government should not forget about poor people, who can not afford computers but need food and shelters. However, I think that computers help people gain more knowledge and experience and find a job to provide food and home for his family.

By overcoming difficulties people gain priceless and essential knowledge and experience. If one has to struggle with a disease he becomes stronger maybe not in a physical way but in a mental way. A person becomes more patient, more self-confident and more attentive. These qualities will help him to win his disease.\n\nSuccess has nothing to do with luck. People have to work hard in order to reach their goals. They face challenges and failures and often they lose. However, people do not give up. They use their previous experience and knowledge to try again and again. I think that difficulties teach us very valuable lessons. Only a man who understands this fact and knows how to use it in the future can succeed. Failures bring us wisdom and new experience.\n\nFinally, between a prudent and imprudent person, the main difference is their experiences and wit. A person learns a lot from the experiences he/ she went through the life. So experiences and previous mistakes help a person to become a successful one.

From my everyday experience, I have to agree with the statement that important decisions should be made by our parents or adult relatives. In the following paragraphs, I will give my reasons to support this statement.\n\nFirst of all, teenage children have the tendency to live in their own fantasies. They do not clearly understand the rules of a real life. When I was 18 years old I thought that the world was perfect and everything seemed to be simple. Teenagers are basically inexperienced, they aspire for independence and try to make their first steps towards freedom. I think that it is like starting to walk when a baby needs its parents for support. An independent life is a big and significant part in a person's life. So, my point is that it is very important to make this step right.\n\nSecond of all, I think that parents have right to interfere in their children's lives. They need to know what kind of friends their children have and how children spend their spare time. For example, I had an eighteen years old friend who got really angry with his parents when they prohibited him from being a friend of a young man. Somehow his parents found out that that young man was occasionally taking drugs. That man was dead in a year because of drug abuse. After that accident, my friend thanked his parents for that interference. Finally, I think teenage children should be more open-minded with their parents.

First of all, travelling with a companion is safer for several reasons. If travellers got lost in a strange city it is easier to find a way back. They can support and help each other if something happened and one of them is hurt. As for me, I prefer to travel with a companion if we travel by car. I think it is very dangerous to be on a strange road by one's self. One more reason to have a companion in a car is that they can change each other if one of them is tired. Second of all, travelling with a companion is more exciting and interesting. They can share all beautiful moments and new experiences. Finally, it helps to save some money because companions can share all expenses on gas, hotels, etc.\n\nFrom the other side, travelling alone can bring many benefits too. For example, one does not have to do things he does not want to. If one is tired he does not have to go to a bar with his friend only because he does not want to leave him alone.

For example, a good lawyer is often paid a very high salary, because he or she has won many cases and people are ready to pay big money for his knowledge.\n\nA second example is that a salary of a surgeon simplicity depends on his experience and knowledge and on how many surgeries he has completed successfully. In this case surgeon's salary simplicity depends on surgeon's success. Secondly, a high salary is an indicator of a prosperous career and profession. People change their jobs, move from one place to another looking for a more interesting and better-paid job. Of cause, some people do not care about salary as long as they like their job, but from my everyday experience and observation, I can state that the majority of people who are not satisfied with their revenue would exchange their current job for another one with a higher salary.\n\nFinally, money plays, maybe, unfortunately, an essential role in our modern life.

However, now I have a few friends from Africa, I can meet many Chinese people on the streets, have dinner at a Mexican restaurant, buy some delicious cookies at a cafe run by the French. It is really wonderful and amazing to see people from all over the world, communicate and work with them. I agree with those people who move a number of times throughout their lives. However, I believe that people who spend their entire lives in one place have many advantages too. First of all, I will focus on the reasons why I support the idea of moving and then I will move on to analysing the opportunities that people have staying at one place.\n\nPersonally, I think that the first and most obvious reason to move from one place to another is to see the world. Of cause, this can be obtained by travelling. Nevertheless, travelling does not give the opportunity to immerse into traditions, customs and just the way of life of the country. It is like seeing beautiful looking boots on a show-window and does not try them on to see if they are comfortable.\n\nThe second reason for moving is the opportunity to gain new experience and knowledge. One can meet new people and new friends, extend one's range of interests. Also, one can find a better job, life conditions and even climate. For example, my husband like the warm and sunny weather. So his dream is to live here in Texas a half of the year and move to Australia for another half of the year to catch warm months. One more example, my aunt does not feel good in sultry and humid weather. So she had to move several times to find a place where she feels comfortable.\n\nFrom the other side, this way of life has some disadvantages.

Also, it is not good for children because they will have to change their schools a few times. Staying in one place has a plenty of advantages too.

Personally, when I get a lower grade on an exam then I expected I know that I could be better prepared. So, next time I will spend more time and efforts to fix my lack of knowledge and do my best on the exam. In this case, low grades encourage me to learn more. I try to analyse my mistakes and avoid them next time. Also, I try to arrange my time more effectively. I know exactly that I can do better than that, so I collect all my strength and focus on the incoming exam. It is a new goal or obstacle that one should overcome in order to continue his path.

I think these qualities are essential for a person who wants to achieve something and succeed in the future.\n\nSecond, students have some kind of competition with each other for higher grades. When a student gets a higher grade then another one, the second student asks himself: \"Why do not I have this grade? Is it something wrong with me? Is he better than me?\" I think every student at least one time asked himself this question.\n\nTo sum up, I think there is no doubt that grades encourage students to learn, gain more experience, knowledge, be more self-confident and persistent.

It is very important to see during a negotiation how one's opponent is moving, is he nervous or relaxed, what he is doing, etc. Scientists say that the body language and facial gestures can say many things about a person, his strong and weak sides, his traits, manners and even habits. To know what kind of man one is dealing with is an essential aspect in negotiation. Many managers prefer to have face-to-face conversations with the future employees.

It will eliminate many further misunderstandings and bring only benefits to both sides.Model Answer 2:\nCurrently, the social networks are becoming more popular among young generation. Therefore, we can say beyond any doubt that modern society prefers to send emails or handwritten letters rather than socialising in reality. In my opinion, the face-to-face communication is more effective to build a personal relationship and to conduct professional arrangement but other ways of communication like email and chat are becoming more popular nowadays as they are easy and more convenient.\n\nTo begin with, by directly facing with other people individual could enhance his conversational speech by learning new words and improving pronunciation. For instance, communicating with a well-educated person could enrich your vocabulary and range of vision. Secondly, there is no doubt that people sometimes want to see the real emotions of a man while he or she writing a letter or an email. Face-to-face communication allows individuals show that feelings entirely put people`s faith in saying the truth. Moreover, connecting with people in real life helps easily make new friends at a later stage.\n\nIt should also be stated that socialising by the Internet also has its benefits. Firstly, people could comfortably confess in some things that could not tell face-to-face. Furthermore, with improving technological devices it is easier for people to write an email or just call due to the fact that it does not take a lot of time to send a message. Secondly, there are a lot of social networks such as Skype, Facebook and Twitter, which permit individuals to keep in touch with friends from other countries all over the world.\nTo sum up, it is easy to communicate within the Internet. Nevertheless, my point of view is that directly facing is essential for meeting new friends.", "original_link": "https://www.ielts-mentor.com/writing-sample/writing-task-2/381-ielts-writing-task-2-sample-155-face-to-face-communication-is-better-than-other-types-of-communication"}, {"essay_topic": "Dancing plays an important role in a culture.", "extra_topic": "", "model_answer": "\nThroughout the human history, dancing has always been an important part of our culture, society and ritual. This is considered as one of the most effective and ancient ways of communication and people all over the world have their traditional dancing styles that not only reflect their unique way of traditions but also their history and culture. I quite agree that dancing plays a very crucial role in a culture.\n\nIf we look back to the history, dancing was a form of entertainment and an excellent outline of arts in all civilisations. It was even a way of performing ritual acts in many civilisations. The main reason it presents the culture of a society is because it is a fascinating combination of different forms of arts including music, songs, costumes, vibrant colours, performance and story. Each of these art forms presents a unique identity of a nation and thus when they are combined together, they become the icon of a nation. If we observe the art forms used in a dancing performance, we are sure to get a very vivid impression of a particular society and their way of life.  \n\nAgain, the dancing has many forms and it varies from civilisation to civilisation. Even a small tribe who has different cultural aspects has a different way of body movements, costumes and music while performing dances. Thus dancing also teaches us about the past history and traditions. For instance, ancient dancing that used the body and facial painting, quite primitive costumes and body movements are totally different than the modern dancing and both of them represents two different periods, civilisations and cultures.\n\nFinally, people\u2019s presentation of happiness, joy, sadness, prayer, story and purposes through different forms of dancing is an excellent means of conveying human feelings and probably a very ancient mean of communication. As communication is the primary way of expressing culture and tradition, dancing plays a vital role in doing so.   \n\nTo sum up, dancing is always a part of our history, tradition and culture and it helps keep people's traditions alive through the ages.

What are some other reasons that people work?", "extra_topic": "", "model_answer": " People in the beginning of the human history started working because they needed food, shelter and other very basic human needs to survive. The primary reason for working, even in this modern era, is to earn money to survive. However, with time the definition of survival has changed and many luxuries of life have become the necessity. Thus in my opinion people primarily works to earn money. However, self-contentment, helping others, saving for future generation and spending quality time are some other important reasons people work.\n\nFirst of all, self-contentment and self-realization are two important factors people work even though they have sufficient money. These kinds of people work to invent something new and try to satisfy their unquenchable thrust for knowledge. Their curiosity, hard work and talent drive them to invent something new that helps millions of others throughout the ages. Scientists, artists, mathematicians, astronomers and explorers throughout the history have done so to make this world a better place. No doubt some of them had personal ambitions, but self-contentment and curiosity were the main driving forces for them to work hard.\n\nSecond, saving for the future, both for their old age and for the future generation, is another reason people work. Someone who has a lot of money cannot guarantee that it will remain the same for ages. Thus many people work to save for the rainy days and the make sure that their future generation will have better standards of life. Further working on something that we enjoy ensures far more quality time than being idle. Thus many of us work because we enjoy what we do. Money is not the primary motivation for working in this case.\n\nFinally, doing something better or helping other is another important reason many of us work. If we look back in the history, we will find numerous famous people who left their conform zone and worked for the betterment of others. They were selfless people who could have easily accumulated wealth but instead they have vowed to help others.\n\nIn conclusion, self-contentment, curiosity and selflessness of many are the three important reasons we have a different world than we had in the primitive ages. Some people work to save for the future while others to help others and to fulfil self-realizations.

It is a holiday, which is celebrated at the end of the winter. Many people gather on the biggest square of the city and see of the winter. They say to the winter good-bye and ask the spring to change the winter. They celebrate the beginning of the life when everything starts to grow.\n\nPeople on this holiday baked pancakes and treated each other with them. Also, many people gathered on the square and played different games. For example, the most well-known game \"pulling a rope\" subsists in that two teams pull a rope. The winner is the team would be whatever side has a longer rope. Other people crawl on the icy pole. People have fun at this holiday even if they just observe those games and do not participate.\n\nIn conclusion, I am sure that \"Maslenica\" would benefit many countries all over the world.

Nowadays we can move from one place to another more quickly, we do not spend much time cooking, we have many different resources of information and means of communication. So, our life now is more dynamic and changeable. During our day we receive a huge amount of information and process it. Students at the same time have more resources to get the information they need. They can go to a library, the nearest bookstore, or borrow it from a friend or even download it from the Internet. I think It is great. Instead of waiting for one's turn to get a book in a library, one can print it from a file downloaded earlier. The great thing about it that one can print only those pages he is interested in and also make marks on the pages to mark important ideas.\n\nAnother important aspect of this is the advantages of using the computer the greatest invention of the last century. Students do not have to spend their time by writing and re-writing many papers. It is really time-consuming. They just type information in and may use many useful features such as \"copy\", \"paste\", \"delete\", \"save\", etc. Also, sometimes students do not have to write down lectures because they already have them on their computers.\n\nThe Internet plays an important role in our life now. We can communicate with the people who are in another part of the planet. We also can get the latest news very quickly. People can ask for a piece of advice or find different kinds of information on the Internet. Students can get their degree online, register for classes, communicate with professors, take tests and even listen to a lecture. I think the great part in it that students may more effectively arrange their time. They can get their task by e-mail and stay home to do it. It really saves time and makes studying more fun especially if a person has to work in order to pay his or her tuition.\n\nTo summarise, I think that many last inventions improved students' life and allowed them to concentrate more on studying.Model Answer 2:\nWith the advanced development of technology, it is easier for students to get information as much as they need these days. As a result, they get more knowledge than the previous generations and learn quicker as well. I personally agree with it and the following essay will discuss it in details.\n\nFirstly, it is a fact that with the existence of the internet technology, people could get more information and data than ever before. The online technology offers various kinds of websites which provide precious and useful information. And students could easily get that precious and important information by connecting their computer to the internet. Consequently, students obtain more information than ever before and it has positively affected their intellectual and intelligence behaviour.\n\nSecondly, the research has showed that with the advanced technology, students are faster in learning and absorbing lessons that they have studied. The technology provides various types of tools and platforms which can be used by students in their study. For example, students could learn new things not only by reading traditional books these days, as they could search some audios or videos on the internet that could give a more comprehensive understanding of the lesson that they are studying. Therefore it is undeniable that students are learning faster these days.\n\nIn conclusion, I strongly agree that technology has positively affected the way students learn these days, as the advanced technology has assisted students in gaining more information than ever before, and students are learning quicker these days.\n ", "original_link": "https://www.ielts-mentor.com/writing-sample/writing-task-2/377-ielts-writing-task-2-sample-151-with-the-help-of-technology-students-nowadays-can-learn-more-information-and-learn-it-more-quickly"}, {"essay_topic": "Holidays honor people or events.

I believe that many countries already have this day, but I think that my day will be more beneficial because it will be celebrated at the beginning of every month. In this essay, I will give the reasons and outline the benefits of this holiday.\n\nFirst of all, to celebrate this day people do not have to go to a restaurant or to a movie, but they will go to the nearest park and celebrate it by walking, jogging, line-skating or bicycling. Some people will go to a fitness centre or a pool. Smoking will be prohibited everywhere on this day. Also, this will be a day of healthy food, fresh squeezed juice and a lot of smiling faces. This day will inspire people with energy for the rest of the month.\n\nSecond of all, people will be called to use their car as less as possible in order to prevent the air pollution and to keep air fresh. Every car has a large impact on the environment. People often drive their car to the nearest store to buy food when they can spend 5 minutes more and get there by foot or bicycle.\n\nFinally, \"Day of Health\" will help people to relax, to slow down the pace of their life. Life is very stressful these days. People are competing for a better job, companies and countries are competing for a market and business.

For instance, I have noticed several times that my 10 years old nephew was teaching my grandfather how to use Facebook, how to operate a digital camera, where to search for a particular information on the internet and lots of such things. So obviously my grandfather learned from my nephew and there are such many technological aspects young people can teach the older ones.\n\nSecondly, youths know the changes and trends of the current world better than older persons and that\u2019s something they can share with the aged people. For instance, my sister who is a sophomore shares numerous information with my father and aunt regarding the politics, social progress, roles of Government, policy changes etc. and to me, my sister seems to be well informed than my father and aunt regarding the current affairs.\n\nFrom my experience, I can see that older people have a better experience and they can advice what are the correct things to do. In certain sectors, like research, teaching, banking etc. they are performing far better than young employees.

In this essay, I will analyse these points and present my view in favour of people who believe that some courses must be required to study by students.\n\nFrom the one side, having a chance to choose what one likes to study can bring many benefits. First of all, a student can be better prepared for the career he likes because he can spend more time studying what he is interested in. Second of all, students will learn with more enthusiasm because they will learn what they like.\n\nFrom the other side, teenagers often can not completely understand what they want to do in the future. So, given a chance to choose, they can choose classes, which are easy to learn and do not take much time to study. As a result of this after graduation, many students can be unprepared to enrol in universities and, of course, make careers. Personally, I think that some courses such as mathematics, literature, writing English must be required for studying by students. This will help them to gain more knowledge and experience, develop the ability to think logically, improve writing skills, etc. So, students will be better prepared for the real world and independence life.\n\nTo sum up, I think that high school should have required courses because it is essential for a student to have a good base for the future life.

Children should learn through playing and communication with their friends and parents. I think that such basic qualities as kindness, self-confidence and just a good sense of humour can not be gained from studying. Children should more time spend with their family, playing and learning with their parents. Imagine that a child instead of playing with his friends does his homework and feel exhausted and tired. Another important aspect of this is that children at their early ages need more exercise because at this age the development of their body is an essential aspect.

It means that a company should treat its clients properly and respect their rights.Of cause a company may lose a part of its profit but the security of its clients must be in the first place. Otherwise, clients will switch to another company and never be back. For instance, a few years ago \"Jonson & Jonson\" produced a new type of painkillers. Unfortunately, this product was not tested properly. As a result of this, many people died and received injuries. The president of the company made a crucial decision to call back all painkillers from all distributors and pay to all injured customers for their treatment. It cost a lot of money for the company but it saved its image and clients. It was a very difficult decision, but the president of the company understood that it would cost him even more in the future because he would not be able to return clients' respect. Losing customers means for a company losing its profit.\n\nSecond of all, in order to succeed in the modern world companies have to compete with each other. Many companies lose their profit decreasing prices on their products. They do not aspire for extra profit but for clients' satisfaction. Companies do it because they want their products sold and their customers satisfied. They offer discounts, free delivery, free service, free Internet access, good return service, etc. All these are done to make their old customers happy and attract new clients.\n\nTo sum up, I think a company, which the only goal is profit will not succeed nowadays.

Are there aspects of a good education that cannot be taught using computers?", "extra_topic": "", "model_answer": "\nThe world has witnessed many rapid changes in almost all areas including education, after the invention of the computer and this tool has become an essential part in many new sectors. The education sector is no exception and the modern education system is so deeply rooted in the computer and internet technology that without these two, modern educations would become meaningless.\n\nWho could have thought only 40 years ago that computer would be used in rural classrooms, modern online based distance education system and in medical colleges? In fact, the modernization in education was possible because of the invention and widespread uses of the computer and internet technology.\n\nFrom physics to aeronautical engineering, chemistry to modern arts, computers are used in everywhere. A complex chemical reaction can be simulated using a computer, the trainee pilots can simulate the real flight in a computer system and even the students in fine arts can learn the digital arts which are created using computers. The changes in education and uses of computers have become a common phenomenon nowadays and a school without a computer lab is considered a primitive one. Math, Physics, Chemistry, engineering, medical, business & commerce subjects can all be better taught using computers. Even arts subjects can be better taught using computers. Subjects that directly involve computers like computer science, computer engineering, electrical engineering, graphics designing etc. can\u2019t be conducted without the help of computers.There are still some aspects of education that require human touches and involvements and can\u2019t be done using a computer. For instance, teaching morality, discipline and responsibility are done by teachers apart from delivering lectures on subject matters and that can\u2019t be done using machines. A student learns many more aspects from the teachers and classmates and that can\u2019t be done using computers. The creativity and leadership quality are two other aspects that are nurtured and inspired by humans and machine can\u2019t take responsibilities for these issues.\n\nIn summary, computers can enhance the scope of better education in almost all of the subjects except teaching some values and moralities of life that can only be taught by humans.", "original_link": "https://www.ielts-mentor.com/writing-sample/writing-task-2/365-ielts-writing-task-2-sample-139-are-computers-essential-features-of-modern-education"}, {"essay_topic": "Nowadays, education overseas has become more accessible and growing numbers of people send their offspring to study in other countries. However, this trend has its detractors.", "extra_topic": "", "model_answer": "\nOne of the greatest advantages for young students to study overseas is that they learn to be independent. Having to cook, clean, manage a budget, take care of themselves, pay bills and take important decisions, they become self-reliance and this instils good quality among them. Often they have to work part-time to make ends meet, and this impresses upon them the importance of work and money management.\n\nAnother important factor of studying in a foreign country is that these children will be exposed to different cultures and diverse ways of thinking. They will become more open-minded and tolerant and are likely to become more adaptable individuals. Getting exposes to different situations, they would become better decision-makers. One of the main motives for sending young people abroad to study is that it enhances their employment prospects. In my experience of living in foreign countries and speaking to various youths, it seems that a foreign education is regarded as something desirable and helpful in getting a decent job. A degree from Britain, for example, is seen as being of a higher standard than one from a developing country. Furthermore, living in a foreign country may lead to fluency in a second language, which is another selling point for prospective employers. In addition, many companies are keen to recruit people with a global outlook.\n\nThere are a few drawbacks, however. For instance, without parental supervision, the new found freedom children experience may lead to harmful practices such as drug abusing and rampant lifestyle. Reluctance or inability to reintegrate into their mother country is another one that is often considered as a negative effect of this trend.\n\nTo sum up, it can be seen that the advantages of studying abroad for children are more numerous than the disadvantages. Of course a lot depends on the age of the child, but I believe that for most teenagers it would be a positive experience.", "original_link": "https://www.ielts-mentor.com/writing-sample/writing-task-2/364-ielts-writing-task-2-sample-138-education-overseas-has-become-more-accessible"}, {"essay_topic": "Some people prefer to work for the same company, whereas others prefer to change jobs frequently.

Staying in one job means these problems are avoided.Another benefit of not changing occupation is that one is able to gain a lot of experience and expertise in his specific profession, thus enhancing job security.

Although some people believe that the phenomenon has no harmful effects on young children, I agree that the disadvantages of it outweigh the advantages.\n\nTo begin with, the benefits of using a computer are widely admitted. As high-tech tools, computers provide children with diversified methods to help them learn efficiently. Animated web pages and incentive applications are designed for teaching and inspiring them to access more information  and that process expands their horizons as a result. Also, children are attracted easily by the interactions in educational computer programs, so that they absorb knowledge effectively in a lively atmosphere, and it proves to be welcomed by both parents and teachers.\n\nOn the other hand, negative impacts of using a computer every day need to be emphasised. Since young children have only acquired inadequate self-control, they are likely to be addicted to computers, video games in particular. Spending too much time on computer games, children will lose their interest in studying as well as communicating with their peers. Moreover, their values and perspectives of the real world might not be well developed once they fall in love with the virtual world, which will have a detrimental influence on their future. Again, using computers for long hours has both physical and psychological effects that would be even more devastating for young children.  \n\nIn conclusion, though computers are helpful to youngsters\u2019 study, the adverse effects they bring weigh more.

Why is English such an important international language?", "model_answer": "\nCountries like America, England, Canada and Australia not only offer courses in English but also have the most talented and skilled teachers. The facilities of their universities, libraries, laboratories are undoubtedly much better than other third world countries. Furthermore, many people believe that learning English language staying in an English-speaking country is the best way and that is why lots of students move to these countries to study.     \n\nThere are lots of advantages in studying English. First of all, it is an international language and in most of the countries, it is either the second language or the official language. With the increasing effects of globalisation, people have to move to other countries for many reasons and in most of the cases, English is the only common language to interact with people. So for the communication people have no other choice but to learn and use English. Secondly, most of the countries use English as an official language and use it for hiring people. So to get a better job, one must be proficient in English. So to enhance the career growth, especially in a multinational organisation, one must be fluent in English. Finally, most of the books, thesis papers and internet article are either written in English language or can be found in translated into English. So to enrich someone's perspective and knowledge, one must be good at using English.         \n\n\nIn my opinion, the primary reason for English language being so prominent is because it is used in most of the countries. The English colonies were almost everywhere in the world and that has different economic, political and cultural impacts for most of the nations. English is the primary language of the technological devices and the internet and this is because the inventors or developers are mostly from those English speaking countries. If a nation wants to embrace the technology, then it has no alternatives than to learn the language first. Most of the computer software and applications are written in English.  Furthermore, with the increasing effects globalisation, people are adopting the foreign music, movies, histories, books and style. So to follow what someone's favourite singer, actor or sports personality is to follow the culture and language of this person.               \n\n\nIn conclusion, the world is considered as a single city nowadays and there must exist a common language and this common language is English. People learn this language to walk with the present trends and there is no alternative and even people prefer to learn the language from the English speaking countries and this is quite reasonable.Model Answer 2:\nNowadays, many people are travelling to English-speaking countries to continue their education. Undoubtedly, if a person wants to have a prominent career, he has to be fluent in English.\n\nEngland, America, Australia and Canada are the best destinations for many. It is clear that the fastest way of learning a language is to be in a country where people use this language. Otherwise, no matter how many books someone reads, he might still not be able to communicate effectively. English is used globally and could be used to interact with people. This is why this is the most powerful language in the world. As for me, I lived in London for two years. When I just got there, I was extremely disappointed, because I could hardly understand their speech, despite having studied the language at the university before. Watching original films and TV programs, communicating with people, listening to their music, I noticed how my skills improved every day.\n\nEnglish has become a global tool of communication. 80% of all e-mails, publications and music are in English. The Olympic Games ceremonies, The UN meetings, the numerous International Awards - all of them are held in the same language. Someone cannot be a promising professional if he does not know English. Moreover, while travelling, someone feels quite confident if he knows English.\n\nOverall, a well-educated person must know a foreign language to succeed in life. This is the main reason why thousands of people move to English-speaking countries.

Another reason is to provide inhabitants with the similar lifestyle.

A group of people believe that the issue could only be solved by the government. I personally agree with the statement and the following essay will discuss it in details.\n\nIt is true that the increasing population in large cities such as Jakarta, New York or Beijing has created some social issues. Firstly, as the demand for houses in big cities increase, the price of properties has risen by double or triple in the past few years. This situation has affected to the middle and lower income class, as they could not afford to buy houses in the city. Most of them purchase properties in more developed areas of the city and consequently they have to spend more money on transportation to the workplace. Secondly, the high demand of housing areas has created some environment issues. As more houses are built in the cities, the number of parks and trees become lesser and lesser these days. As we all know that trees are beneficial for human beings, as they produce oxygen and absorb pollution. Consequently, air pollution in these cities has become worst than ever these days and the number of people who have respiration problem has increased.\n\nIn order to restore these conditions, it is the government task to restructure the city, as they are the one who has the power and the authority. The government should stop giving new permits for city developers. They should expand and develop new areas, therefore some of the city\u2019s people will move to the new area and it will gradually reduce the density problem.

However, people nowadays are confronted with so many problems, such as the deterioration of the environment, air pollution and the explosive expansion of population. Some people claim that the damage to the environment is an inevitable consequence of economic development. From my point of view, this is only an excuse for the ignorance of environmental protection.\n\nIn order to make more profit, some manufacturers and factories are only keen on the pursuit of profits, caring nothing about the protection of the environment and the recycling of waste water. For example, about fifty percent of people in Shenzhen possess a private car, and the ownership is increasing by 7,000 each month. The exhaust gas and irritating noise impair people's health greatly. The prosperity of economy is obtained at the cost of people's health and the damage to the environment.\n\nThe lack of awareness of environmental protection is another factor causing harms to the environment. Some near-sighted local governments are only concerned about economic development but pay very little attention to environmental protection, misunderstanding the economic development says for their achievements and that environmental protection only cost money.\n\nIf people and the authorities concerned have a long-term developing perspective, I think the damages to the environment is avoidable. Along with the development of technology and people's living standard, the government should take effective measures to handle the problems arising.

In order to dedicate to the mutual development, many developed countries spare no effort to help the poor countries by means of technological, medical and financial aid, which, to my mind, is quite essential to the development of the world.\n\nFirstly, aids from developed countries optimise people's living standard and eradicate poverty in the poor countries. Due to the backwardness of science and technology, people in some undeveloped countries and regions such as Africa, Latin America and Asia suffer a great deal from poverty, hunger and the scarce of water. International aids from developed countries have improved their living environment and helped them with the development of agriculture, industry and economy.\n\nSecondly, international aids give good medical care and help promote hygienic condition in the poor countries. Malaria, cholera and smallpox were once severe threats to people's health. With the help of the World Health Organization and some developed countries, these diseases have been eliminated soon and the residents in the infected areas survived these deadly diseases, which would have devoured millions of lives without international aid.\n\nFinally, aids to the undeveloped countries, in turn, benefit the donators. Due to the limitation of natural and human resources, the production cost rises sharply in the developed countries. With a view to reducing cost, many countries transferred their assembly lines and production bases to the developing countries, which not only solves the problem of low rate of employment in the developing countries but also make full use of the local resources.\n\nNevertheless, some countries are showing great concern about the mal-expense of their aid aroused by bureaucracy and corruption of some governments.

Where do these problems come from? What should we do to change the situation?", "extra_topic": "", "model_answer": "Model Answer : \nSchool violence becomes very protrusive in many countries, most of which are caused by the attitudes of students. Some governments and the authorities show great concerns about the problems. From my point of view, these problems are aroused by three factors, the development of society, the influence of family and media and the weakness of school education.\n\nThe rapid development of the society offers more opportunities for the young students to contact the outside world. Due to the lack of social experience, some youngsters are not capable of distinguishing right from wrong. Curiosity drives them into imitating what they see on TV or from the people around them. Therefore, it is easy for them to be addicted to alcohol, smoking and drugs. Some students even smoke and take drugs at school.\n\nFamily violence is another major factor causing problems in schools. Family violence hurt children both physically and psychologically. Physically, family violence will hurt their tender body because children are still in the stage of development. Psychologically, physical punishment will hurt children's self-confidence and make them have a tendency of violence. Recently, school gunshots hit the headlines frequently, which should partly be attributed to the family violence.\n\nFinally, the weakness of school education is another factor causing school problems. Some schools only stress students' achievements in their study, neglecting their moral education. Therefore, even some top students are apt to stride on the criminal road.\n\nTo solve these problems, I think we should take the following measures. Firstly, schools should strengthen students' moral education, giving them correct directions and cultivating their ability to tell right from wrong. Secondly, parents should spare some time to communicate with their children, resolving difficulties and troubles for them timely. If the school and family can join hands in solving these problems, I think the students will develop healthily and the environment in schools will become much clearer.", "original_link": "https://www.ielts-mentor.com/writing-sample/writing-task-2/342-ielts-writing-task-2-sample-116-many-problems-in-schools-are-aroused-by-the-attitudes-of-students"}, {"essay_topic": "Traffic is a very serious problem.

There should be no public or government restrictions on what they do.", "extra_topic": "", "model_answer": "\nThe issue of freedom of creative artist has extremely grown in importance in most countries over the few decades. It is considered that government should not interfere with their works and the artists should be free to do whatever they want. While I accept many artists are sharing their valuable ideas for the tremendous development of this world, I believe some certain area they should be controlled by the rules and regulation.  \n\nAdmittedly, the human civilisation has approached this sophisticated stage because many creative artists have bestowed us an enormous number of significant ideas and opinions in the form of pictures, music or films. As an example, many creative artists like Leonardo Da Vinci, Pablo Picasso and  Michelangelo Buonarroti had first drawn the design of aeroplane; but, at that time nobody could think that human can fly and everybody thought it was just imagined of his mind. Although it required a long time, but it became true that human now can fly. This example makes it clear that the work of artists can lead to immense improvement of humankind. Therefore, many people think that they should be free with their works for the advancement of the human being.\n\nOn the other hand, there are some vital reasons why the work of artists should be controlled in some certain area. Firstly, most people in this world believe in the God; so the artist should not create such type of acts, which hurt the religion. If this type of activity they make, it may bring colossal embarrassment to the human society. Secondly, the artist should not go against any culture and costume of a country. In this certain field, government can limit the practice of an artist.\n\nIn conclusion, the creative artists are indispensable in our society although some artists have tended to draw against our cast, creed, and religion.

However, I think it is wrong to drop studying English, as machines cannot do perfectly, especially in translation, which is a sophisticated process and needs so many skills.\n\nFirstly, what machines can do now is translate word for word, without consideration of context. When a computer translates scientific works, they can do a satisfying job. But when it comes to literature works, they cannot weigh every word according to different situations, and thus their job cannot display the path of original works. Suppose we give a poem by Shakespeare for translation, we can imagine how ridiculous the translation would be.\n\nSecondly, machines cannot convey the manner of speakers. If the speaker says in different tones like surprisingly, sarcastically or delightedly, the machine will not be able to express the emotions of people; therefore, we have no idea of what speakers really mean. When there is face-to-face communication, we can understand people judging from their expressions, body gestures and so on, even if we do not use many words. But machines cannot do this.\n\nOn the other hand, English study offers one a new and different perspective of English-speaking countries because language and culture are closely related to each other. Machines can never do this. When we study English, we not only learn the language but also know more about the culture, history and customs. Machines can never replace the process of English study and give us a better understanding of the cultural background.\n\nTo sum up, translation machines help us in some way but it doesn't mean that we can quit studying English because English study can give us much more than the English language itself.(This model answer has been prepared by the site developer.

More and more women, confined to babysitting and chores previously, have stepped out of their family and become career women. But in the meantime, career women are confronted with considerable nuisances, one of which is baby caring.\n\nWomen's participation in the employment contributes a great deal to the society. Thanks to the women's patience, warmth and carefulness, most women are employed as secretaries, nurses, consultants and babysitters. But due to the pressure from work and family, they cannot concentrate fully on their work. Some countries and governments adopted some active measures to resolve the contradiction, such as the policy of feasible working time, which renders women some freedom. However, this is not a radical solution.\n\nFrom my point of view, the government should subsidise women in baby caring and provide charge-free facilities and staff members to relieve women of their pressure. On the one hand, women can focus themselves on their work and study, with no distraction from their family and children. In return, factories and companies can benefit a lot from the practice of subsidiary, which exempts them from the losses caused by female absentees.

Some people claim that it is cruel, while some other people argue that it is beneficial to the development of science.

An analysis of this question reveals that television programs present three major concerns in the case of children, including depictions of violence, the use of profane language, and the representation of poor moral role models.Television programs that portray violence are a paramount concern for parents nowadays. Recent research has shown that children may commit acts of violence because they wish to emulate the behaviour that they see on television. This is especially true when violent acts are committed by well-known action \u201cheroes.\u201d In addition, television programs show cartoon figures, as well as actors, committing violent acts.

I agree with this opinion to some extent but I think the main reason for these increase of sale is people\u2019s necessity, not advertisements.\n\nOn the one hand, producers apply various methods to market their products for consumers.

Companies spend a lot of money advertising the products and they use celebrities and famous people to bring their favours into their stories.

So this success is held in a limited circle.\n\nOn the other hand, an intensive growth of sales of people\u2019s main consumer products is as a result of increasing their needs to them. The role of advertisement in this area is confined to help the buyer choose the best products and not persuade them to buy unnecessary goods.

The advancement of technology in this domain has given birth to smartphones, tablets, mp3 players and other gadgets that are not only a great source of entertainment but are instrumental in fetching valuable information. One cannot imagine living without them in this modern era. People believe that children are getting more dependent on these electronic devices which are alarming and we should persuade them to participate in other outdoor physical activities. Though this move is laudable, I don't agree fully. This essay will analyse the merits of both views before presenting an opinion.\n\nPeople believe that young one of society should take part in physical sports. Proponents of this viewpoint say that physical activities make them mentally strong and physically fit. Playing sports and different games is instrumental in learning the art of teamwork, develops skills vital for competitions and nourish their leadership qualities. Moreover, it develops their stamina, improves metabolism, sharpens their reflexes and braces them to face everyday life challenges. It has been medically proven that the rays emitting from these electronic devices are not good for human vision. Furthermore, one can truly enjoy the game by playing it physically. For instance, football, a game that is different on the field, where it requires stamina and passion compared to a few clicks over the computer. Apart from that, it helps people to socialise, a trend missing in our present generation.\n\n\nOn the contrary, electronic gadgets like computers, notebooks, smartphones etc play an important role to improve the mental abilities and intellectuality of a child if used wisely. Children can play different mind games that improve their thinking power, decision-making skills and harness creativity and innovation. Moreover, physical games and entertainment can lead to harmful injuries which can be fatal. For instance, parents in Karachi usually prefer their children to spend time at home due to fear of terrorism and abduction for ransom.\n\n\nTo recapitulate, the aforementioned provides plausible arguments for both views.

However, nowadays creative projects have become very expensive and can not bring pay-off to its authors. Some people think that the government should pay for those projects and of course, observe precisely how those funds are being spent and on what type of projects it is being used.\n\nThis is quite obvious that no entity or organisation knows a nation's cultural aspects and needs better than the government. This is why a government can evaluate which sphere of cultural life have the necessity of development. It also achieves its goals of public loyalty by funding a specific field of the Art and by controlling budget by giving maintenance only to projects they are interested in.\n\nHowever, funding the Art selectively can lead artists to the lack of freedom in expressing themselves. In other words, then those who have powers, will use the money to regulate cultural life. As a consequence, it can then limit the imagination and put artists into borders they would be scared to cross. Thus, here comes the censorship, which has nothing in common with the main democracy principles. For example, a similar situation emerged in the Soviet Union, where the government controlled the Art and therefore the only career an artist could pursue is praising the Communist Party by his creations. This shows how artworks can become political works when they are very strictly controlled.\n\nAs an alternative of letting a government control spending money on the Art, a non-governmental independent organisation could be established. It must consist of the best cultural activists from a country. This would add a certain level of budget control and would guarantee that there are no limits for the arts and artists.\n\nTo conclude, I believe that funding the Art is one of the main tasks of a state, but the purpose of it should be the development and enhancement of the arts, not making it serving government's political needs.", "original_link": "https://www.ielts-mentor.com/writing-sample/writing-task-2/322-art-should-be-better-funded-by-the-government-but-there-must-be-more-control"}, {"essay_topic": "Wild animals have no use in the 21st  century and trying to preserve animals now is just wastage of money.", "extra_topic": "", "model_answer": "\nA large number of people possess the belief that spending money to save the wild animals is a  waste of national budget as these animals have almost nothing to contribute to the human\u2019s progress or lifestyle.

Spending money to protect wild animals is a prudent investment as scientists and ecologists agree that those habitats are important for the human survival.

For instance, modern international pop and rap music, as well as classical traditional country songs all, vary from each other and people listen to them with great interests. This is because music has been part of our daily lives even in the ancient times. In this essay, reasons on why music is necessary for every Filipino people and  the importance of the Philippine traditional folk music over foreign songs that young Filipinos and Filipinas always hear will be discussed.\n\nMusic is a vital part of every Filipinos' lives. Firstly, Philippine folks considered it to be one of the most popular and ancient modes of human expressions. It features largely in all histories and all cultures and indeed has been one of the main ways of passing on cultural traditions to new generations of the country. Secondly, because of this, many people view music as a positive influence for the societies. This influence on individuals is wholly beneficial as it is a long-established way of communicating and helping us understand the whole range of human emotion and experience in a more spiritual language than words can represent.\n\nHowever, the classical music traditions of the Philippines are not necessarily part of the music many Filipinos and Filipinas experience today. In the modern world today, most of the country's young people constantly exposed themselves to loud modern foreign songs as a result of globalisation via the Internet. But I think that it is more important for young people of the country to learn traditional music to enable them to know the origins of our Philippine ancestors.\n\nIn conclusion, I think that we need traditional music because it is an integral part of the human expression that we cannot really separate from our lives even if there are the various evolution of modern music we tend to listen every day through the web nowadays such as American rap songs and Korean pop music.

Keeping the old customs will help one to overcome the cultural shock and the change of the environment.

In this essay, I will give different reasons why people decide to follow the customs of the new country or to keep their own customs.\n\nIf one is from the country with strong and old traditions, I think it will be rather difficult for him to adapt to the new customs and moreover to reject his own. That is why some people from the same country try to live together and to create their own community where the old traditions are kept. They can not break the customs that were created by their ancestors. For example, some nations are restricted in certain kinds of food by their traditions. So, they do not go to the restaurants unless their traditional food is served there. Some nations according to their customs have to wear certain types of cloth because their religion tells them to do so.\n\nFrom the other side, if one is from the country with traditions similar to ones of the new country it will be easy for him to adopt and to follow the customs of the new place. He will not feel much difference. Probably, the most difficult part of his relocation will be to accustom to the new climate.\n\nI think that people of the new country are friendlier when they see that foreigner follows their customs.

There are some People who think that competition in children should be made, also others believe that children who are taught to co-operate as well as become more useful adults. There are advantages and disadvantages for both of the arguments.\n\nTo begin with, what is good if a sense of competition m children is made? They could develop themselves more and more as they learn and study a lot to win the competition. To prove this, in Korea, it is popular - even common now - to have a tutor who comes to student's house to teach extra pieces of study with paying a lot of money. They learn faster than what they learn at school. Furthermore, during the vacations, students study abroad to learn English for a month instead of revise school work. If they have experiments such as study abroad, it is one of the greatest plus points to go to the famous well-known high-school. Moreover, there are four big school exam and two national examinations to test students' level of studies. Generally, only the highest 40% can go to the good quaternary high schools and colleges. Children learn as much as they can, to win the competition to obtain good quality schools.\n\n\nOn the other hand, as they are busy to enter the schools and study individually with their own tutors, there are problems. They become selfish. They become careless and don't help others a lot if it is about studies. There will be no co-operations for them. Then, why are there companies for many people to work in? Each of them is clever, however, there are weak parts and strong parts for each person. To co-operate is to improve this part. People talk and listen to what others thinking of and learn. That could also be a great opportunity to learn instead of learning alone with one teacher.\n\n\nIn conclusion, I strongly agree with that children should be taught to co-operate rather than compete. Nobody is perfect. People learn together, work together to develop each other. Therefore, I want parents and teachers to educate children concentrating on co-operation, not compete and ranking them.Model Answer 2:\nThere is too much debate about whether children should be learned to be more competitive or cooperative members of society. In my opinion, both behaviours are important and cooperation is more important than competition.\n\nOn one hand, as we live in the very competitive society, we need to teach our children the sense of competition in a positive way. The most obvious advantage to encourage competition among children is that it makes them more creative and open minded and opens the doors for better future opportunities for them. For illustration, children work hard in the study because they compete with other classmates to receive high marks, this will help them to get a very good job in the future. Moreover, they become more independent and rely on themselves because they know that nobody else will be there to do their duties.\n\nOn the other hand, I believe that cooperation is mandatory to be encouraged for many reasons. Firstly, cooperation helps children to learn from each other. For example, when I was at school team, I learned how to play table  tennis  with  my friends and we learn a lot  of skills from each other and when we play in the final round with other school teams,  we get a very good score in the final. Secondly, cooperation teaches children the skills linked to sharing, as a result, they become a kind member of society.

For example, if you are a university student, you are supposed to submit your term paper as typed and printed document, they no longer accept hand-written papers. Furthermore, some manufacturers do not distribute information leaflets but give a website address on their products\u2019 packs, thus only the Internet users can have an access to product details. The last but not the least, the computer skills became a crucial requirement for employment in urban areas.\n\nMeanwhile, inhabitants of rural areas do not need new means of acquiring information.

E-mail and instant messaging have replaced snail mail and telegraph. Twitter and news websites have replaced television and radio as the preferred source to quickly disseminate news. Common tasks such as booking tickets for a movie or travel can be done in minutes using a smartphone. Money transfers can be made in seconds using online banking.\n\nThe younger generation has picked up the technology very quickly. Using a computer is now taught in the primary school itself so that the children can learn the skills that later will be helpful in every arena of life. A large fraction of the older generation, however, struggle using technology in daily life. This is because, unlike youngsters, older people could not learn computers. They had little time and motivation to learn and embrace technology in their daily life.\n\nToday, the world is moving towards a polarised society, where one group of people uses and depends on technology for their daily tasks, while the other group prefers working the traditional way.

They also learn the importance of studying in group and respect other students, which helps them to improve their social skills.\n\nMoreover, teachers are required in the learning process because they acknowledge some student\u2019s deficiencies and help them to solve their problems by repeating the same explanation, giving extra exercises or even suggesting a private tutor.

Some oppose the development of a single language on the grounds that it may lead to cultural erosion and a loss of local linguistic knowledge. Yet, I am of the opinion that it is possible to use an official international language and still retain one\u2019s own language and culture.\n\nFirstly, many countries already use an official language or languages. For example, in India, there are two official languages: Hindi and English. In a country such as India where there are innumerable languages spoken, there is a need for official languages to ensure communication between different sections of the population and the different states. In China, where different dialects are spoken, Mandarin, the official language, enables people from different provinces to comprehend each other.\n\nSecondly, in an age of rampant globalisation, there is no doubt that an international language is inevitable. How is an African businessman going to conduct businesses in China when there are such differences between their languages? In this sense, not only is an international language inevitable, but also a necessity for trade, commerce and economic expansion in the 21st century.\n\nThe critics opposing the adoption of an international official language argue that it would lead to a loss of cultural identity. However, the use of an international official language doesn\u2019t mean that local languages will die out. For example, English already functions as a kind of unofficial international language but this doesn\u2019t mean that people solely converse in English or they neglect their own language. English is used in specific contexts (trade, business, etc) and native languages are used for everyday instruction.\n\nIn brief, as the world becomes smaller the need for an official international language seems unavoidable. English has already assumed this role although its status is unofficial. In my view, the use of either an official or unofficial international language is necessary to facilitate communication in a time of rapid globalisation.", "original_link": "https://www.ielts-mentor.com/writing-sample/writing-task-2/310-ielts-writing-task-2-sample-84-it-is-important-to-have-a-single-language-as-an-international-official-language"}, {"essay_topic": "When people need to complain about a product or poor service, some prefer to complain in writing and others prefer to complain in person.", "extra_topic": "", "model_answer": "\nIt is rather difficult for me to answer the question how I prefer to complain: in writing or in person because sometimes I just do not have a choice. For example, if I order a product using the Internet from another state or even country, I will more likely have no opportunity to speak to a representative of a company in person. So, in some cases I choose to speak in person and in others I prefer to complain in writing. However, I believe that every option has its advantages.\n\nFrom the one side, complaining in writing brings many benefits. First of all, one does not have to spend his precious time driving, waiting for his turn and talking with a representative. He can just send mail or e-mail and get all explanation he needs. Second of all, I think it is the best way to avoid an unpleasant conversation. Personally, I do not like to complain about anything especially, in person. Finally, sometimes it is impossible to have a face-to-face conversation because a company which provided a poor product or service is too far away.\n\n\nFrom the other side, complaining in person has some benefits too. First, this type of complaining provides an immediate feedback. So, if I have some complaints about a company's products, I will receive all information and explanation right away. However, sending a company a letter and getting a feedback can take more than a month. Second, face-to-face conversation is often more effective. People talk to each other, see each other facial gestures and body movements, which can tell a lot about a person. In addition to these practical benefits, in case, one can not receive a credible explanation from one representative, he always can require to talk to another person. For instance, my husband recently had some extra withdraws from his account by his bank and he was not aware of it. So, he went to the bank and explained to the bank's representative the situation and they together found the solution and that money was given back to my husband's account. I think, in this case, face-to-face conversation is the best way to complain and get feedback fast.\n\n\nIn conclusion, I think that if I have to complain about a product or poor service I will do it in person. However, if a face-to-face conversation is impossible, I think I have nothing left but to send a letter or write an e-mail there.Model Answer 2:\nA lot of times, people need to complain about a product or poor service which is quite common nowadays. It is, therefore, important for one to identify the best medium for your complaints to have the desired effect. Rising complaints both in person or in writing have their pros and cons but I personally prefer to lodge my complaints in writing.\n\nFirstly, putting down your complaints in writing has the advantage of getting to the person intended. That person is usually at the top of the hierarchy. For example, if someone complains to the driver of a bus about over-speeding or reckless driving, the information might not get to the manager of the transport company but may only end up with the driver which might not stop the driver from over speeding in the future and therefore the complaint would not make any impact.\n\nSecondly, writing to the manager about a poor service gives the manager time to understand and assimilate the gravity of the situation and understand how important it was to you the consumer for you to take your time to write about a certain problem. In addition, if one decides to complain in person, emotions may come into play and may lead to the exchange of words and the desired effect is therefore not achieved.  Written complaints also have the advantage of being referred to in the future.\n\nIn summary, written complaints have the advantage of getting to the individual in charge, being able to be referred to in the future and giving the receiver ample time to understand the situation and to address it appropriately. As a result, I would prefer to forward my complaints in writing.", "original_link": "https://www.ielts-mentor.com/writing-sample/writing-task-2/309-ielts-writing-task-2-sample-83-complain-about-a-product-or-poor-service"}, {"essay_topic": "The costs of medical health care are increasing all the time.

Some countries take the responsibility of the citizen's health and provide free medical care whereas other countries think it is an individual\u2019s responsibility. I would support the second opinion as I believe that the health insurance is affordable and it helps to get the better services.\n\n\"Nothing is free in this world\", this saying is true when it comes to free medical services. Though some countries provide free medical facilities, they indirectly get that money from civilians via tax. For instance, in Australia the health service is completely free, however, the income tax is as high as 35%. On the other hand, the insurance could be economical. For example, a person is earning a thousand dollars a week can afford 50 dollars for the insurance premium. Moreover, if the income increases, it is not mandatory that the premium would also increase. It is understood that some people might not be able to afford health expenses. However, due to growing competition between insurance companies, many affordable plans are available in the market.\n\n\nIt could be argued that if an individual has to pay for his health, he can ignore it and that could result in an unhealthy nation in long-run. However, a free service could encourage the unnecessary visits as well. It is certainly an individual's responsibility to take care of his own health. Moreover, if hospitals have only those patients who are unwell then they could provide better service. For example, when a hospital has one hundred patients out of which only thirty patients are sick, hospitals still has to spend a considerable amount of time with other seventy patients. Patients who are actually sick could receive a far better service and attention if the remaining seventy could be eliminated.\n\nI believe a government could focus more on other areas like infrastructure development where individual cannot contribute.

The argument for intellectual separation holds some strong advantages. Firstly, by allocating students to classes based on levels of intelligence, high achievers have the opportunity to excel in a way that they couldn\u2019t in a normal class. Owing to the fact that they can be placed into an unrestricted educational environment, students can excel with intellectual freedom.\n\nSecondly, there is a strong argument in regards to inhibiting a child\u2019s intellectual growth by restricting them from moving above their peers if their mental capability permits. Why should we limit the intelligence of our future generation? For instance, many of today\u2019s highly successful artists and entrepreneurs in the world have come from an unrestricted educational background and have been allowed to explore their mind and careers to the fullest extent.\n\nIn conclusion, although I believe an educational environment for young learners should promote equal opportunity, I honestly think that creating a more liberal environment which enhances the learning capabilities of intellectually-gifted children will not only benefit individual\u2019s careers but future society as a whole.(This model answer has been prepared by the site developer.

From my everyday experience and observation, I think that every option has its advantages and disadvantages. I base my opinion on the following points.\n\nFrom the one side working for a large company brings many benefits. First of all, one has better medical insurance, higher salary. Often employees of a large company have less responsibility. Moreover, they feel more secure because their company has more clients and this means better chance to survive on the modern market. However, one working for a large company has less chance to be promoted because one's manager does not want to lose his or her job unless she or he is promoted too. Also, from my observation, managers of a large company do not pay much attention to one's solutions and suggestions.\n\nFrom the other side working for a small company has many advantages too. Firstly, one has better chance to be promoted. Secondly, one can talk to the owner of the company about any improvements that can be done in order to get more profit. Another important aspect of working for a small company is the opportunities to find out more about how a company works. As a result of this one can gain more experience and get better recommendations. However, this also has some disadvantages. For instance, one can get less salary, worse medical benefits, etc.\n\nTo sum up, I think that every person chooses for himself what he or she wants.

Undoubtedly, advantages and disadvantages of both academic learning styles have to be evaluated.\n\nFirstly, on the one hand, despite being the more traditional educational approach, learning from theory in relevant academic discourses to identify established knowledge allows us to gain a professional insight. For example, students can easily identify facts and opinions from past discourses. In addition, students acquire knowledge more easily when given relative theoretical examples to build upon. For instance, in subjects such as history or sociology, studying textbook examples allows students to unravel complex academic theories which they could expand on. Alternatively, there are some disadvantages for students.\n\nOn the other hand, there is no doubt that students could find themselves reading tedious and monotonous academic papers. For instance, university degrees involving the evaluation of numerous \u2018long-winded\u2019 academic discourses provide a little inspiration for students, discouraging enthusiasm. Obviously, interest can be stimulated through empirical research in class. By this, I mean that \u2018the human brain learns best by doing\u2019.

I believe that overseas education gives students many excellent opportunities including better education, better environment, becoming self-reliant and so on despite some of the negative aspects that are not tough to control. \n\nApart from being self-dependant, another important factor of pursuing the education in a foreign country is that those children will be exposed to different cultures and ways of thinking.

In my experience of living in foreign countries and speaking to various youths, it seems that a foreign education is regarded as something desirable and helpful in getting a decent job. A degree from Britain, for example, is seen as being of a higher standard than one from a developing country. Furthermore, living in a foreign country may lead to fluency in a second language, which is another selling point for prospective employers. In addition, many companies are keen to recruit people with a global outlook.\n\nThere are a few drawbacks of this trend that cannot be avoided.

While medical care and education are perhaps the highest causes to which money can be contributed, the arts and athletics are in some ways just as valuable. So, to ask the government to not extend support to these two areas could be just as detrimental to the welfare of society as the lack of sufficient health care and education.\n\nThe Romans believed in \u201cMens sana in corpore sano\u201d, usually translated as \"a sound mind in a sound body\". In short, that there is indeed a correlation between a healthy body and healthy mind. When we are healthy, we feel better and so are more likely to be productive academically. Plus, the practice of sports can also teach us the very same discipline we need for our studies. Why even a brisk walk or watching an exciting athletic match can refresh the mind for greater work. Moreover, sports can serve to create healthier bodies, which in turn would serve as a form of \u201cpreventive medicine\u201d thereby cutting down on medical costs. In the same vein, the arts are known to induce a sense of well-being in performers and audience alike, reducing mental problems and their associated physical manifestations and again, medical costs. As such, building theatres and stadiums, which spur interest in the arts and sports respectively, actually would be practically identical to spending money on medical care and education!\n\nNow I realise the question specifically addresses the building of theatres and sports stadiums by the government. Some people would contend athletics and the arts can still be enjoyed and practised without such constructions. I would assert that these buildings stand as the altars to the sports and art worlds, inspiring would-be athletes and performers. Without such venues where would sports spectators and music aficionados be able to enjoy these events? Now some other people would also say business could support their construction, but we know the avarice of business could very likely jeopardise the lofty spirit of athletics and the arts just as well.

It is a very beautiful city that attracts many people every year. My close friend is going to move here after her graduation. She already found a job and she asked me to help her with an apartment. Knowing her very well I think I can enumerate the majority of things she will like and dislike about my city.\n\nFirst of all, I believe she will like a huge amount of museums, theatres, movie theatres, etc. My friend is from a small town, so, she can not enjoy all these benefits at her native town. Secondly, it seems to me that she will like the way people live here. The pace of life is much faster here than in a small town. People are always in a hurry, they try to catch a bus, and then they run to the nearest subway station, go to an office, meet new people, etc. Also, I think my friend will like people here. They are very friendly and ready to offer a help to those in need. She will also like the huge garden in front of the parliament house and the people who come to visit there. We have some attractive rivers here and I\u2019m sure she will enjoy the calm environment and sweet breeze of these rivers. Finally, I\u2019m planning to take her to a nearby restaurant that serves  lots of uncommon and delicious foods.\n\nUnfortunately, my friend will not surely like some things. As a result of a huge amount of cars and factories,  the air is polluted here. One more thing she will definitely not like is the weather. It is quite humid here. However, I think she will also like the public transport here. The bus services are run by the Government and it is quite regular. If one in a hurry he can take a taxi, which also is quite cheap and provide a good transport.\n\nIn conclusion, I believe that in spite of all mentioned above disadvantages she will like this city.(This model answer has been prepared by the site developer.

It seems that one possible solution could be to relocate large companies and factories as well as their respective employees out of these urban areas and into more rural ones. I strongly agree that this would have a positive effect in making cities more livable.\n\nTo begin with, the traffic problem in cities doesn\u2019t only exist from commuting employees, but also the general public travelling around the city. While this may be a fact, if the number of worker\u2019s vehicles is reduced on city streets, a large percentage of traffic will obviously decline in rush hours. For example, peak hour traffic is undoubtedly made up largely of staff from companies going to and from home.\n\n\nSecondly, in regards to housing problems, populations will always continue to grow in cities and therefore inadvertently decrease the number of cheap and available apartments. This is certainly obvious, however, a large proportion of these apartments are occupied by employees from large firms and their families. If this workforce is relocated to housing estates in the country, city apartment blocks will fall in price and certainly increase in availability.\n\nIn conclusion, by relocating workers to rural areas to work and reside, heavy traffic conditions and lack of adequate accommodation in city centres will obviously change for the better.

Discoveries such as telephones, internet and advancement in medicine field have been proven to be very important for changing and shaping people\u2019s lives. But the discovery that has proved to be most beneficial is the advancements in agriculture field such as improved irrigational facilities and improved fertilisers.\n\nIndia is primarily an agricultural nation, where still 60% of the population lives in villages. People mostly depend on agriculture and related activities for their livelihood. In earlier days, people were mainly dependent on monsoon and did not have an alternative method of irrigation. If monsoon failed, it would result in drought and hundreds of people would either die or become bankrupt. Also, with the poor quality of seed and bad farming practices, the output generally remained low and the majority of the crops were destroyed by rodents and worms/insects. We were not self-sufficient in producing food grains and hence had to import it from other countries.\n\nBut with the advent of technologies and new improved farming practices, India's agricultural production has surged. We are no longer only dependent on monsoon. Although monsoon still remains as a major source of irrigation, but now we have dams and irrigational channels that provide water for cultivation throughout the year. The government has also focused on providing education on new and improved seeds, fertilisers and new farming techniques such as crop rotation. With the use of these new techniques, we have not only become self-sufficient in the production of our food grain but have a surplus amount for several years. India has also become an exporter of many food grains such as rice, wheat, sugar etc. This has not only helped our economy to grow but also made life easier for all Indians.\n\nIn a nutshell, the discoveries made in the field of agricultural have proved to be a boon for us. We are now able to feed 1.2billion people on our own and yet have a surplus amount. This has also improved the plight of farmers and has relieved huge pressure from our economy by becoming an exporter of food grain rather than an importer.[ by - Preeti ]", "original_link": "https://www.ielts-mentor.com/writing-sample/writing-task-2/293-ielts-writing-task-2-sample-67-what-discovery-in-the-last-100-years-has-been-most-beneficial-for-people"}, {"essay_topic": "Watching television is bad for children.", "extra_topic": "", "model_answer": "\nTelevision is ubiquitous these days; I have not come across single household where there is no TV. But is watching TV good for children? Well, I am a strong believer that anything done in moderation is good and same goes with children watching TV.\n\nFirstly, with the omnipresence of TV, it is impossible to keep children away from it. Moreover, TV provides an efficient source of learning for children if right channels are watched. We generally are able to grasp and remember more things when we see and hear rather than read it and here is where TV is really useful. These days we have different channels focusing only on children like cartoons or more educational channels like animal planet, discovery channel etc. All these channels help in educating children in an effective manner. It is often seen when the children are really young around 1-2 years, they react to TV; whenever a song is being played, they start dancing, and they often listen to songs and starts singing. This definitely suggests that TV helps children in their development and make them active.\n\nAdmittedly, TV also has some negative impacts on children. Sometimes, they squander too much time in watching TV and watching wrong channels can also have a negative influence on them. Therefore it is of utmost importance that parents keep a close eye on their children. With the advent of technology, we now have televisions with child lock system in place, which could prevent children from watching irrelevant and adult channels. Parents should extol the importance of watching news channels to develop overall general knowledge of children. When I was growing up, my parents made sure that I watch the news for at least half an hour in a day. This really helped me in improving my General Knowledge and I gradually developed the interest in politics and also watching different debates and group discussions helped me improving my speaking skill and as a result, I won several prizes in debates and quizzes at school and college level.\n\nIn a nutshell, I think as every coin as two sides, so does television. Watching TV in moderation and under parents\u2019 guidance is good for children entertainment and learning but it is important that parents keep a check on the channels that their children watch and the amount of time being spent on watching TV.(This model answer was written by Preeti Ghuraiya.)", "original_link": "https://www.ielts-mentor.com/writing-sample/writing-task-2/292-ielts-writing-task-2-sample-66-watching-television-is-bad-for-children"}, {"essay_topic": "People who have original ideas are of much greater value to society than those who are simply able to copy the ideas of others well.", "extra_topic": "", "model_answer": "\nPeople are born with different abilities and talents.

In the following paragraphs, I will outline the basic concepts of my position.\n\nFirst of all, I will least the major disadvantages for employers. In today's market, a company must be very flexible in order to compete with other firms. So, imagine the situation when a company can not fire its employees to stay on the market. It will lead to loose not only profits but the clients, market share and competitive ability also. Now, imagine the situation when a company is growing fast, everything is good and the next few years are going to be excellent. So, employers need more people to extend the production. However, nobody can tell what will happen in a few years. In this case, employers will be afraid to hire new people and extend their business because they will not be able to fire them if something goes wrong. Another important aspect of this is that a company can not have the best employees. It can not hire the better one without dismissing another employee.\n\n\nWhat kind of disadvantages will have an employee in exchange for this kind of job security? First of all, it will be very difficult to find a job if one is not the best because an employer does not want to spend money on one's education. Besides, an employer will not have a chance to fire one if he does not do his job well. Secondly, employees with this kind of security tend not to perfect themselves because after they are hired they can not lose their job.\n\nIn conclusion, I would like to add that this statement has some positive aspects too such as constancy, a strong spirit of the company, etc. This system takes place in Japan and some companies succeeded in it. But I think that the reason of it subsists in the Japanese traditions, the particular cultural features, habits and customs.

Nowadays, many people take the option to change jobs, while others prefer not to. In my essay, I will explore the good and bad points of the above attitudes.\n\nOne of the main benefits of staying in one job is security. Changing employer often means a period of instability, where one may have to think about moving house, or temporarily losing a steady source of income. Staying in one job means these problems are avoided.\n\nAnother benefit of not changing occupation is that one is able to gain a lot of experience and expertise in his specific profession, thus enhancing job security. One\u2019s company may recognise their loyalty and reward their service. On the other hand, those who often change jobs may be seen as unreliable, lacking in experience and employers might be reluctant to hire and invest training in them.\n\nHowever, there are arguments in favour of changing job frequently. One is that a worker improves his employability. Working in several different jobs often means that the individual has more skills. Such people are seen as more dynamic and versatile.\n\nAnother benefit of changing jobs frequently is that one never gets stuck in a rut. From my own experience, I got bored when I spent too long in a job. Following this, the quality of my work would suffer. I also believe that employers generally don\u2019t tend to greatly reward loyalty or commitment. Increased wages and promotion are often easier to attain by changing jobs.\n\nOverall, it can be said that the disadvantages of changing jobs are the advantages of staying put, and vice versa...

However, I candidly believe that historic structures should be preserved. This essay outlines the coherent reasons for doing so.\n\nIndustrialization has evolved, thus leading to an insatiable desire for wealth. Demolishing of old buildings for spaces to build casinos and hotels has been a norm these days. Old buildings are a depiction of our native history for example; the Jalian Wala Bagh in Amritsar, shows the people who lost their lives, this revives patriotism in the youth. The Taj Mahal in India, a monument of love serves as an example of unconditional love. These are emblems which will assist children to learn history. In New Zealand, old earth pots were discovered from old monuments, that helped assess which cereals our ancestors ate.\n\n\nSecondly, History revitalizes the tourism industry, an instance of this is the Fort Jesus Museum in Mombasa, Kenya. A huge number of local and foreign tourists pay a visit to the museum regularly. This thus leads to an appreciation of the local currency and cross-cultural pollination, therefore bringing a country to a trajectory model. The funds raised through tourism may be used for refurbishing the old structures.\n\n\nTo recapitulate it all, I firmly believe historical structures are a heritage of any country. Thereby destroying them is like unleashing a lethal war on our history. An example is better than a precept, and history can, therefore, be taught by the use of old monuments.\n\n[Written by - Andy]Model Answer 2:\nSome people think that old, historic buildings are no need for the city and they should be destroyed and replaced with modern ones. However, other people believe that historic buildings must be preserved in order to know and remember our past. For several reasons that I will mention bellow, I agree with those people who want to preserve old, historical buildings.\n\nFirst of all, by preserving historical buildings we pass our history to our future generations. I think that our children should know their history, learn from it and respect it. People need to know their traditions and customs, which are priceless and irreplaceable. Our history is our knowledge and power. In my opinion, we need to preserve and restore historical buildings. By destroying them we show our disrespect to our forefathers and their traditions.\n\nSecond of all, by preserving historical buildings a city can attract many travellers. Welcoming tourists a city can get many benefits including money, which can be spent on preserving historical buildings as well as on improving roads and facilities. Every city has its own tradition and history which is reflected through the art and creation of the building mostly. Destroying those heritage means destroying the old value and history.\n\nAlso, many tourists mean a lot of new business opportunities. Another important aspect of this is that businessmen will be willing to build new recreational centres, hotels, movie theatres, shopping centres to make a city more attractive to travellers. In addition to those practical benefits, many people will have the opportunity to get a job. All this is good for the economy of the city.\n\nTo sum up, I believe that preserving old, historical buildings can bring only benefits to a city and all humankind.", "original_link": "https://www.ielts-mentor.com/writing-sample/writing-task-2/285-should-city-preserve-old-historic-buildings-or-destroy-them"}, {"essay_topic": "Some people say that advertising encourages us to buy things that we really do not need.

We need it so we can make good decisions when we go shopping.

For example, many grocery stores now sell prepackaged lunches. These are very convenient for busy parents. They can give these lunches to their children to take to school. Busy parents don\u2019t have time to look at every item on the store shelf, so without advertisements, they might not know about such a convenient new product.\n\n\nEven products we are familiar with may be improved, and advertising lets us know about this. Most people use cell phones, but new types of cell phone service become available all the time. There are different plans that give you more hours to talk on the phone, you can send text messages and photos, and next week probably some even newer type of service will be available. By watching advertisements on TV it is easy to find out about new improvements to all kinds of products.\n\nAdvertisements keep us informed about prices.

In order to make the right choice people should discuss every possible decision and its consequences. Making an important decision alone can bring many negative aspects. For instance, a person can reveal his selfishness or impatience and the consequences of that decision can affect many people in the future. I think that a good and wise decision can be born only by great discussions because people can share their knowledge and experiences a look at the problem from different sides and aspects.\n\nSecond of all, I think that making an important decision alone is unacceptable especially for a company. Imagine that a chief makes the decision about increasing a production line without discussing it with his employees. In this case, a part of company's profit will be spending on extended purchase of raw materials. So the shareholders will be left without dividends. This decision may lead to getting rid of company's shares and as a result of this declining the value of a company as a whole.Finally, taking a big decision without discussing others is sometimes negative because when the question arises of taking a major decision, people often feel tensed and for this single reason he/ she can't think about all the issue.Again our friends , family members, co-workers care about us so much and when they are asked to opine about and issue like : 'whether I should do it or not' ; they will give the best opinion possible as well as both negative and positive sides.

It is a way of communication among people of one country and different countries and nations. People watch TV to find out about the latest news, weather, sports, etc. It is a great way to learn new and extend one's range of interests. Scientists say that children spend the same amount of hours in front of TV as they do in school. I think that this can be said about many grown people too. Also, television is a great means of eliminating stress and tension. One can relax and leave one's troubles behind lying on one's favourite sofa and watching a comedy. However, some people believe that television has destroyed communication among friends and family.\n\nPersonally, I do not agree with this statement. A couple centuries ago people spent their time gambling, reading, gossiping or playing chess. I do not think that television is a cause of destroyed communication among family members and friends. First of all, if members of a family have common interests and they want to make each other happy they will always find many ways to spend their time together and be close. Otherwise, if people avoid each other and they do not have anything to share with each other they will find television a great way to escape from this miserable existence. I believe that many people chose family and their friends over some soap operas or a movie.\n\n\nSecond of all, I think that television can be a great resource of subjects to discuss. Many people watch different educational programs to find out more about their environment, nature, wildlife animals, economic situations, etc. So, when they gather with their friends they discuss important issues and argue with each other in looking for the truth.\n\nMy husband and I often watch the news channel to keep abreast of the latest news. After that, we always discuss some issues we concerned about. Also, we like to watch a TV show \"the funniest animals\". We like this program because it makes us laugh.

This has created a whole generation of adults who have never cooked a meal for themselves. If there were fewer of these restaurants, then children would not be tempted to buy takeaway food.\n\nThere is another argument that blames the parents for allowing their children to become overweight. I tend to agree with this view, because good eating habits begin early in life, long before children start to visit fast food outlets. If children are given chips, ice creams and chocolate rather than nourishing food, or are always allowed to choose what they eat, they will go for the sweet and salty foods every time, and this will carry on throughout their lives. Parents decide what to buy and let their children eat and many parents know and feel that their children are overweight and yet let them eat high calorie contained foods like fast foods. If parents try to make their kids understand that those type of fast foods are not good for their health and draw a restriction on how much their kids are allowed to eat then the problem can be solved partially.  There is a third factor, however, which contributes to the situation. Children these days take very little exercise. They do not walk to school. When they get home, they sit in front of the television or their computers and play video games. Not only is this an unhealthy pastime, it also gives them time to eat more junk food. What they need is to go outside and play active games or sport.\n\nThe two views discussed play an equal role in contributing to the problem, but I think we have to encourage young people to be more active, as well as steering them away from fast food outlets and bad eating habits. We need to have a balanced approach.", "original_link": "https://www.ielts-mentor.com/writing-sample/writing-task-2/281-ielts-writing-task-2-sample-55-the-number-of-overweight-children-in-developed-countries-is-increasing"}, {"essay_topic": "Children should be required to help with household tasks as soon as they are able to do so.", "extra_topic": "", "model_answer": "\nThe issue about whether children should help with household tasks as soon as they are able to do so is open for debate. Some people say that children should devote more time for playing with their friends, watching TV and studying. However, other people believe that children should help their parents with household tasks. Personally, for several reasons, which I will explain bellow, I adhere to the latter point of view.\n\nFirst of all, I think that every child should have his or her own responsibilities. When I was a child my parents taught me how to make breakfast in the morning. So, I woke up, went to the kitchen and prepared a couple of toasts for breakfast. It was easy and I enjoyed doing it because I liked the way my parents thanked me and I felt that they were proud of me. Also, my mom always wanted me to know how to cook, clean and iron my cloth. Thanks to the learning, nowadays, when my maid can not come to my house I handle all household tasks myself.\n\n\nSecond of all, performing household tasks teaches children to value the job of people who did it. When I was a child I did not imagine that cleaning house could be so time and energy consuming. So, when I began to do some of the household tasks by myself I began to respect the job of others and tried to collect all my toys after my playing with them.\n\nFinally, doing household tasks teaches children to arrange their time. In addition to those practical benefits, help from children allows parents to have more spare time for their personal lives and for the children. A family can have more time to spend with each other talking, watching movies or just enjoying the beautiful moments.\n\nTo sum up, I think that children should help their parents with household tasks. Doing household tasks helps them to grow into independent, self-confident, and attentive persons who respect their parents.(This model answer has been prepared by the site developer.

In the following paragraphs, I will analyse both these options and present my view.From the one side, living in a modern apartment building brings many benefits. First of all, it is cheaper than living in a traditional house and paying different kinds of fees I am not familiar with. For instance, my friend, who recently bought a new house for his family, said me that it is much easier to live in an apartment and I tend to believe him when I see his bills. So, living in an apartment will definitely help me to save some money. Second of all, since I live alone I do not need a big house with many rooms. I just need a bedroom and a living room where I can take my guests and have my workplace.

However, others aspire to changes and new experience. Personally, for the several reasons, which I will explain bellow, I prefer the first approach to life.\n\nFirst of all, changes in one's life bring many benefits. One tries new things, gains new knowledge and experience. I think it is great because without changes life becomes boring. I always try to make changes in my life. Moreover, when I feel that my life is boring I do not feel well about it. I feel like I spent those days for nothing. I did not do anything exciting, I learnt nothing interesting and I just wasted my time.\n\n\nSecond of all, people need changes. Furthermore, we need obstacles to overcome and reach our goals. I believe that changes make us stronger, more persistent, more self-confident, and more patient. Also, I feel that all people who succeeded in life like changes and new experience because it is impossible to be the best at some field without perfecting the present knowledge and gain new experience. People catch every opportunity to learn more and change their life for the best.\n\nFrom the other side, people who like their lives to stay the same are very permanent. They have the same job all their life, the same habits, the same weekends and even the same years in years out. I think it is boring. What will they tell their children about their lives? What kind of contribution will they make for the society? I think such people are just afraid of changes.\n\nI think curiosity and aspiration to the new experience are two of the main reasons of human evolution.

Traditionally, holidays have been seen as a time for relaxation and as an opportunity to visit another country in order to find out about its geography and customs. Nowadays, however, it seems that other types of holiday are becoming popular.\n\nSome people want their holidays to be adventurous and find this more exciting than going to the beach or visiting museums. On an adventure holiday, you may stay in quite basic accommodation, rather than a luxurious hotel. Activities may involve things such as bush walking or cycling, or may form part of an aid project designed to help communities in remote areas. Holidays such as these are popular with people of all ages and can often help to promote tourism in rural environments.\n\nThe increasing popularity of dangerous sports has also boosted the number of adventure holidays; for example, water sports, mountain climbing or paragliding. These holidays are more popular with the younger generation, as they can be both physically and mentally demanding. Participants are often seeking the sort of thrills that they cannot get in ordinary life.\n\nThere is now greater awareness of the damaging effects of mass tourism and this may be one reason for the changing nature of holidays.

The following essay will discuss the qualities that a supervisor should have in details.\n\nFirstly, a good supervisor should lead by examples. As a leader, his way and style of working will be viewed by his staff, therefore he should lead his team by giving good examples. For instance, when a supervisor wants his team to have good absence records, he should never come late as well. He should become the role model for his teams by coming on time and work with discipline attitude. This example will motivate his team to come early in the morning.\n\nSecondly, a good supervisor should have the capability in managing his team. As a supervisor, he should not be objective in judging his staffs, but he should treat his team professionally. For examples, when a supervisor needs to prepare an absence schedule, he should make the timeline fairly for all his teams. He should not make any time schedule which is unfair and would only be beneficial for certain people.\n\nThirdly, a good leader will also pay attention to his team. He will help and assist his staffs who face difficulties at work. For example, some staffs may be facing difficulties with their new computer programs, and it is the supervisor's task to give some training and coaching to them until they understand the new system.\n\nIn conclusion, a good supervisor should have some important qualifications in his work, such as lead by example, have a good management skill and would assist his team.[ Written by - Darwin Lesmana ]", "original_link": "https://www.ielts-mentor.com/writing-sample/writing-task-2/276-ielts-writing-task-2-sample-50-what-are-some-important-qualities-of-a-good-supervisor"}, {"essay_topic": "In some countries, young people are encouraged to work or travel for a year between finishing high school and starting university studies.", "extra_topic": "", "model_answer": "\nIt is quite common these days for young people in many countries to have a break from studying after graduating from high school. This trend is not restricted to rich students who have the money to travel but is also evident among poorer students who choose to work and become economically independent for a period of time.\n\nThe reasons for this trend may involve the recognition that a young adult who passes directly from school to university is rather restricted in terms of general knowledge and experience of the world. By contrast, those who have spent some time earning a living or travelling to other places have a broader view of life and better personal resources to draw on. They tend to be more independent, which is a very important factor in academic study and research, as well as giving them an advantage in terms of coping with the challenges of student life.\n\n\nHowever, there are certainly dangers in taking time off at that important age. Young adults may end up never returning to their studies or finding it difficult to re-adapt to an academic environment. They may think that it is better to continue in a particular job or to do something completely different from a university course. But overall, I think this is less likely today when academic qualifications are essential for getting a reasonable career.\n\n\nMy view is that young people should be encouraged to broaden their horizons. That is the best way for them to get a clear perspective of what they are hoping to do with their lives and why. Students with such a perspective are usually the most effective and motivated ones and taking a year off may be the best way to gain this.Model Answer 2:\nPeoples are divided on the issue that countries should encourage the young peoples to do jobs or to travel before attending university. Some people think that it is better for students to attend university, while others believe that travelling and working before joining the university for formal education is better for the students to understand the world.

In my community, many predicaments persist such as illiteracy, health problems, and environmental issues. However, I feel that an ever-increasing gap between rich and poor is most tragic and this can only be curbed by ensuring education for all. Therefore, if I get free time to serve my community, I will educate poor and lower-middle class children.\n\nA problem at home affects the whole family. A sheer number of problems in a community also affect people belong to this! Though common problems are being addressed by the authority and their efforts are appreciable, nothing has been done to reduce the social gap in my community. In reality, rich are amassing wealth while poor are becoming poorer. I would like to spend 12-15 hours a month to educate less privileged children to contribute to ensuring their education so that someday they can change their fate. I came from a middle-class family and my parents worked really hard to secure my education. The chance I got made me realise it can change our community and our life.\n\n\nI think the initiative will bring families together and encourage others to help deprived children. In India, the literacy rate is not satisfactory and most poor are illiterate. They do not send their offsprings to schools, while children from rich families study in the best school in town. Thus, the gap between rich and poor is increasing generation after generation and the only education can change the wind.\n\nIn conclusion, social gaps can only be abridged by education. Hence, I will spend my free times to educate children in my beloved community.\n\n[Written by - Bhikshukkumar Patel]Model Answer 2:\nI think the question what would I do if I had a chance to improve my community is difficult. I have in my mind many things, the improvement of which will make our community better place to live but they all require the participation of many people and, moreover, they require investments, which I can not provide. For example, my community is quite noisy. We have the huge mall just in front of our community, so traffic jams are very common for this place. I think that the construction of a few pass-by roads will benefit all people who live here as well as people who drive by every day.\n\nUnfortunately, the question is what I can do for my community giving a few hours of my time every month. I think I can not do much, but I still can help someone in my community. For example, I can babysit. I know a couple of families with little children, who can not afford to spend much money on the babysitter. One of these families is a single mom with a little girl. Julia, this is her name, is a waitress in a restaurant. She is a great person and we became close friends. So, sometimes I offer her help with her child when she has to work in the evenings. Another family has two funny little twins. One time their parents asked me to babysit their children because they had to attend an unexpected presentation.\n\nI think this kind of help brings many benefits to my community. First of all, people become friendlier. For example, those families, which I mentioned above, became friends after I introduced them to each other. Secondly, people get to know each other and feel more secure in their houses and apartments. Finally, I am ready to help those people because I am sure that they will help me too.

While it is true that the energy level and fresh ideas of youth can rejuvenate a company, the steady hand of experience can still best guide a company in most cases.\n\nIn English, there is a saying, \u201cYou can\u2019t teach an old dog new tricks.\u201d In the fast-paced world of business, bolstered by even faster hi-tech innovations, a younger more pliant mind would seem to be able to adapt with greater flexibility, while such an environment might boggle an older more set-in-its-ways mind. Take, for example, Microsoft\u2019s Bill Gates, whose energy and brilliant insights as a youth helped him to pioneer new territory in the computer software world and establish a digital empire. Now as a more mature CEO, this king of the \u201ccomputer\u201d mountain is constantly on the verge of being knocked down by upcoming digerati entrepreneurs. However, it is now the experience he has accumulated as an older man which keeps him on top. So, combining the vigour and innovation of younger workers with the experience of older workers would seem to be the winning hand in the world of business.\n\n\nThe assertion is to give opportunities to the younger generation. If everyone retires at 55, there will be a smaller pool of experience at the company. So, who will show them the ropes of the trade? It would be as if we lopped off the last few chapters of a textbook. On this point, the argument would seem to be built on false presumptions.\n\nAnd think of all the other problems retirement at 55 would create. With life expectancy in many advanced nations at 70-plus years, how would the state along with private enterprises be able to support their retirement pensions? The economic repercussions of such an idea could be great.\n\n\nBesides, the Western form of capitalism is built on competition and merit and not seniority according to age, and democracy is built on equality for all regardless of one\u2019s age, so the argument clearly goes against these two pillars of Western society.\n\nGranted, my counter-arguments are perhaps as simplistic as the original assertion itself, but without qualifying the assertion with greater supporting evidence or background information, both sides can be argued. Nevertheless, even after thoroughly considering the argument, I believe I would still adhere to my viewpoint that the assertion lacks merit for the aforementioned reasons. Besides, when I am 55 I do not fancy the idea of being put out to pasture. I think I will still be full of vitality and have a desire to work, so I hope my workplace will view me as a treasure house of valuable experience to pass along to the next generation and keep me on until I am at least 65 if not older.Model Answer 2:\nUnemployment is one of the leading problems in many overpopulated countries. Owing to this, few companies offer voluntary retirement services to the staff members above the age of 55. I strongly agree with the given statement. Offering positions for younger generation has major benefits. Firstly, the young people work faster, stronger than the elders, who are weaker and slower at work. Just as the companies which are based on labour work require stronger and healthy labourers. Secondly, they are competitive and creative work sectors which enable the projects to grow at a faster pace. Such as in IT companies most of the employees are under 55. Lastly, the selection of new personnel can reduce the problem of unemployment to some extent.\n\nHowever, on the other hand, it is argued that older generation should be allowed to extend their services. They have experiences in particular kinds of work, in which the new staff may lack knowledge and proper experiences. For instance, many businesses require experience in particular field to compete with the opponents and they prefer experienced and aged people. Next, it could be insensible to terminate the honest and worthy members. Therefore most of them would like to continue with the old workers. Finally, they serve as the best resource of knowledge and skills, which is essential for the community survival.\n\nOverall, it is clear that elderly contributes a lot to the companies. However, they cannot be extended to work for longer times.

Unfortunately, international tourism creates tension rather than understanding between people from different cultures.", "extra_topic": "", "model_answer": "\nToday the world is more connected than any time before and people from all over the countries can arrive at their destination within 24 hours. However, while this possibility permits to millions of individuals to encounter different cultures every year, the phenomenon of the international tourism brings also conflicts between people with different habits and costumes.\n\nTo begin, tourism creates isolation more than integration. In fact, tourists prefer to look at different places, costumes and habits like sitting in front of the television screen, watching a documentary, more than sharing time with the indigenous population. Furthermore, tourists don't respect foreign habits and cultures, often because they don't understand it. For example, they throw the litter on the ground, or even worse they don't respect their hosts\u2019 religion.\n\n\nNevertheless, the effects of international tourism are not all negative. Sometimes tourists fall in love with people and places they visit and decide to live in there, acting as mediators between cultures and enhancing integration. It's the case of lots of tourist guides that decided to move abroad and enjoy a different lifestyle and culture, trying to share their feelings with visitors. Also speaking the language of the place we visit can help us understand people from different cultures.\n\n\nIn addition, a large amount of money around the tourism business contrasts the tendency of some countries to close their border to foreign people. This can lead to a better comprehension of these cultures and so to integration.\n\nIn conclusion, the biggest industry in the world have to feel the need of changes in the way tourism is structured, so it could become a mean of integration and reciprocal understanding more than create tensions between cultures.Model Answer 2:\nThe growth of tourism and the numbers of people travelling to other countries for their vacations has led to debate as to whether this is beneficial. I believe that there are many problems which arise out of the tourist industry, and will examine these in detail.\n\nMany people argue that travel broadens the mind. However, this statement does not fully hold water. I would argue that spending a few weeks in another country is not long enough to gain a proper understanding of an alien culture. A foreigner visiting Britain might be met with the traditional British reserve, and mistakenly conclude that the British are unfriendly. Furthermore, some people are unwilling to open their minds. A Western traveller to an Arab country is unlikely to consider that the veiling of women is acceptable.\n\nBeing a tourist in a foreign country brings with it problems that can lead to the dislike of the native people. Firstly, a foreigner is vulnerable and is often ripped off by locals. Secondly, the language barrier can lead to misunderstandings. Thirdly, tourists are often hassled to buy goods, which can ruin a holiday. When I went to Bali, people tried to sell me something every five minutes, and this totally spoils my sunbathing.\n\nLocal people also often end up disliking foreigners. Visitors may mistakenly act contrary to local norms, or they may just be plain offensive, as many drunken British holidaymakers must seem to the Spanish. Global tourism can lead to hostility from the native people, who may feel their traditional way of life is under threat. Additionally, the relative wealth of the foreign visitors can cause envy and resentment.\n\nIn conclusion, I would say that I largely agree with the argument that global tourism creates misunderstanding between people from different cultures and that the differences are often a cause for conflict rather than celebration.", "original_link": "https://www.ielts-mentor.com/writing-sample/writing-task-2/272-ielts-writing-task-2-sample-46-international-tourism-creates-tension-rather-than-understanding-between-people-from-different-cultures"}, {"essay_topic": "It is better for children to grow up in the countryside than in a big city.", "extra_topic": "", "model_answer": "\nSome people believe that it is better for children to grow up in the countryside than in a big city. However, other people think that a big city gives more opportunities and it is good for the long run. Personally, for several reasons I think that it is better for children to grow up in a city that offers numerous advantages.\n\nFirst of all, it is very important for a child to grow up in a healthy environment. Children need fresh air, not polluted by the huge amount of cars and factories of the modern city. In the country, they can spend more time exercising and walking with their friends. Scientists say that now children spend the same amount of time watching TV as they do at school. Probably, the possibility to join their friends for a play will change this proportion. Another important aspect of this is that parents will have more time to spend with their children as a result of eliminating traffic jams and decreasing driving time as a whole.\n\n\nFrom the other side, children have some advantages living in a big city. For example, they have more opportunities to choose from what they want to do. They can choose to attend ballet school, school of art, gymnastics, etc. For the long run, it is good for them. They will be better prepared for a life in a \"real world\" and they will have more chances to make a good career and succeed. Moreover, a big city usually has many entertaining centres with movie theatres and play stations. When I was a child I liked to go to the movie theatre with my parents to watch a premiere.\n\n\nOne more reason to choose a big city for a child is that a city provides better live conditions and services such as medical, dental, etc. My friend lived in the country for a while and one time he and his family had to drive a couple of hours to the nearest medical centre when his child got a heavy cough.\n\nTo summarise, I agree with those people who want to raise their children in a city. The plenty of opportunities offered by a city helps children to find what they really like and be the best at it. Moreover, despite the air pollution, children get a better medical service that is good for their health.Model Answer 2:\nBringing up young generation in a big city is not as good as the countryside. I partially disagree with this statement. In my view, cities are the best place to grow up children and to live. However, cities have some drawbacks which will be discussed in this essay.\n\nMany people opt to live in large cities rather than the countryside because they prefer to live in the metropolitan area than remote areas. Such a good benefit is an employment. People, who are living in a city can easily get a job in different types of professions.\n\nAnother reason is the easy availability of transportation services, large complex network maps of buses and trains covering almost all surrounding suburbs of a city, which can save a lot of valuable time spent by travelling with the own vehicle, which is more convenient and economical when your children go to school. And you will know where they are.\n\nHowever, the cost of living in a city is usually much higher than in the countryside. Inhabitants of cities have to pay higher prices for housing, transport, and even food. Moreover, the big cities have some social problems such as high crime and poverty rates in comparison with the countryside. Furthermore, the air quality in cities is often poor, due to pollution from traffic, and the streets and public transport systems are usually overcrowded. As a result, city life can be unhealthy and stressful to our children.\n\nAfter analysing the essay, we can conclude that those points are the important factors when considering living either in the urban or rural area. Apart from those, entertainment facilities, well-developed infrastructure and living with latest trends are other reasons for living in cities.", "original_link": "https://www.ielts-mentor.com/writing-sample/writing-task-2/271-ielts-writing-task-2-sample-45-it-is-better-for-children-to-grow-up-in-the-countryside-than-in-a-big-city"}, {"essay_topic": "Children should never be educated at home by their parents.", "extra_topic": "", "model_answer": "\nNobody can say with a full confidence whether children should be taught at home or at any children's institutions. There are many different children and everyone demand of education suitable only for him.\n\nBut for most of the children, the best way of learning the life is being in the children's institutions. Nobody would argue that contacts between children of the same age are very important for bringing your child up. Such a contact is very important for playing, entertaining and learning to live with other people. The harmonious living with other people, to my mind, is the first task for any man. Lack of this harmony sets problems and troubles.\n\n\nThe children need space to run and make noise, to jump and cry. Do you or your neighbours allow these actions for your child? If you live in town, it is difficult to find a safe place to play. Kindergartens give such a possibility. They give space, a lot of toys and constructions for physical exercises. So, if you have bad living conditions, the kindergarten is the best way for you. But if you have a large family with many children and enough space, you may keep your child at home. You should be sure that the child feels, dressed and comfortable. His brothers and sisters give him necessary contacts. It's noticed long ago that children in big families are much more easy-tempered and calm. They are located in the more harmonic world than others.\n\n\nSometimes differences in age put troubles in contacts between children in large families. Then it is better for the children to be sent to the kindergarten (school). But if quarrels don't last for a long time, everything is all right. In general, quarrels develop an ability to cooperate with people. They develop a personal initiative and force setting the balance. In such a way the child gets lessons of life. Oddly, the quarrels often take place in kindergartens and schools and we shouldn't fear it.\n\nSide by side with quarrels parents often are afraid of colds which happen in kindergartens more frequently. Parents prefer keeping the child at home. But for a healthy child odd cold (if illness occurs, it goes its normal course) can't make big harm to the child. And if the child is adaptable to the conditions of public places earlier it would be better for him in future.\n\n\nIn general, I am a follower of the theory of keeping children in adapted places such as good kindergartens. But keeping children in such a place can't replace family and home. Only together they make the harmonic and beautiful union.Model Answer 2:\nAt the present time, children have the choice where he wants to study at school or at home. Thus, a lot of children are taught at home and never go to the school. It\u2019s believed that parents should stop this kind of curriculum and give the children to the normal school. I strongly agree with the rubric above, because of parents won\u2019t be worried about the safety of their child and why don\u2019t study at home if it gives good results?\n\nFirstly, parent\u2019s in charge of their child and they know what is necessary for their kid. Therefore, some parents prefer to teach their kid themselves rather than giving them to the school. Parents always worried about surrounding of their child, because nowadays environment influencing on children very strongly. But when children at home, they will be sure that no one pressuring on their child.\n\nSecondly, schools aren\u2019t always giving results that parents are expecting. Thus, parents have decided to take it on their hands and teach children by themselves. Parents always will control their \u201cstudent\u201d and I can\u2019t say that school can do it either.

Modern technology is rapidly changing the world's living standards that result in creating a single world culture. New technologies including Internet, television, electronic media, means of transportation, etc has a great impact on creating a similar culture all around the globe. Bellow I will list my reasons to support my opinion.\n\nFirst of all, Internet and e-mail have changed the way people communicate with each other. The Internet brought many benefits. It is a new means of communication, a fast access to information and news. People communicate with each other, share their ideas, happiness and difficulties. We have a great opportunity to find out more about countries and their history.\n\n\nSecond, the modern means of transportation allows people to move from one place to another very quickly. A few centuries ago it was impossible to imagine waking up in one country and falling asleep in another.\n\nFinally, as a result of all mentioned above the boundaries between countries, their traditions and customs are erased. Many people migrate during their lives. Some of them are looking for a better place to live, others want to get new experience and knowledge or just pleasure. So, many families are created between people from different countries. Traditions fuse and evolve into other ones or just vanish.\n\nTo sum up, modern technology has a great impact on the way people live now. It is creating a new single world culture where traditions and distances are no longer of that importance.Model Answer 3:\nAt the present time, modern technology has created a mono-cultural world. Due to the internet, rapid communication facility, improved transportation facility, TV, satellite channels etc. people are sharing similar information and the modern technology has made it possible to access data very easily. People all over the world are using similar technology, accessing same websites, watching same movies and following same fashion styles. As a consequence, the tradition, lifestyle and way of life all over the world are getting similar. Therefore, people are widely accepting cultures, fashions and trends of other countries and sometimes forgetting their own cultures. I partially disagree with the rubric above and it'll be shown in the following essay.\n\nCurrently, almost in every home has their own TV and the same data are shown on it. Channels all over the world are broadcasting programs and people are accessing more international channels than their national channels. For instance, when I was younger I used to watch one TV show and amazingly, my friend from another country also watched it every day. Another example can be, when there is any international sports event, people all over the world are watching it at the same time. It's obvious from my example that it doesn't matter where you are living; the mass media is the same in every country. Thus, the influence of TV and the internet is quite enormous in creating a single culture. Yet, this is partial as many people around the world are still struggling to earn their daily bread and the technological facilities are inaccessible to them.\n\nHowever, the opinion of human beings shouldn't rely on only the mass media. People should limit themselves from the technology that we have nowadays. Because the consequences aren't just going to come in a psychological way but in a physical way as well we should be very wary of this. For example, while an individual is working in front of the computer his body is adjusting itself because in a chair the whole mass of person lays on his back and in the near future it can cause fatal diseases such as numbness or even paralysis. This example clearly shows that the mass media is impacting on people only partially but not entirely. The modern technology has made our life easier and more convenient and yet there exist many demerits that we can\u2019t deny.\n\nAfter analysing both benefits and drawbacks of modern technology, I've concluded that the modern technology has indeed reduced the distance and gap among nations but the difference still persists.\n ", "original_link": "https://www.ielts-mentor.com/writing-sample/writing-task-2/269-ielts-writing-task-2-sample-43-modern-technology-is-creating-a-single-world-culture"}, {"essay_topic": "Some people say that computers have made life easier and more convenient. Other people say that computers have made life more complex and stressful.", "extra_topic": "", "model_answer": "\nAt present computer is one of the essential parts of our daily life. Many people of today's society are of the opinion that computer is the blessings of modern science which make our life more comfortable and handy while others oppose this concept but my inclination is toward the former.\n\nOn one hand, it is argued that due to the more dependency on the computer, life is more tensed and complicated now. The most vital point for the demand which can initially be mentioned is that excessive technology based recent life. For example, modern school education systems are mainly computer based so students have no opportunity to learn mathematical skill even small subtraction and addition they cannot count without a computer. Besides Children are too much addicted to computer games rather than other outdoor activities and finally our future generation are becoming more machine dependent and physically disable and it results  seems like in near future  horror science fiction will be true. A further point is that computer hard disk crash and viruses are like natural disasters and make our life literally impossible.\n\nOn the other hand, there are quite plausible reasons how the computer is becoming the part and parcel of our everyday life. What can be cited first regarding this is due to communication and information technology now World is in our hand. Anyone can reach any corner of the world within in a second. There are so many ways to communicate with each other such as email, online chatting, voice mail, video chat etc. To clarify this matter from home any one takes part in a job interview, conference or any online class. He/she does not need to go there physically but in the digital world, it is possible. What's more online marketing, banking etc. make our life more convenient so we can enjoy a strong personal relationship. Last but not the least, any business and official work can be accomplished efficiently because of electronic data management, for instance, electronic files are easily stored and maintained rather than paper documents.\n\nIn a nutshell taking all the aforementioned pros and cons into account, I personally opine that computer is the most wonderful gift of our life.Model Answer 2:\nWith the advent of technology and computers, our lives have totally changed. Today, we see computers being used in every sphere of life; be it, at offices to store massive data; be it, at colleges to help research works or by housewives to learn new recipes. Though admittedly, use of computers can also be done in negative ways, but I think there are more pros than cons, and computers have certainly made lives easier for everyone.\n\nWith computers, access to information has become very easy. It is immensely helping financial institutions, police department and big businesses to store and use data for constructive purposes. In earlier days, all the business transactional data was in form of files and managing these files and searching for information was a cumbersome task. Computers have also helped students in a great way. Now, instead of going to teachers, they can browse for information online. They can find multiple research papers and discussion forum online. For instance, when I was studying for MBA, I finished my secondary research on the internet and read about 100 online books to complete my thesis. I could study at my own pace and in a comfortable home environment.\n\nAnother area where computers have helped us is in the communication field. It enables us to keep in touch with our loved once by means of internet chats, video calls like skype, VOIP, social networking sites and various applications. Though I agree, we can contact each other by phone also, but phone calls are quite expensive especially international calls, but now we can contact out family and friends; and often see them without spending the extra penny. Emails have revolutionised the business communication world and aptly made them a formal mode of communication and documentation.\n\nBut, in my views, the most significant use of computers have been applied in the field of scientific research like building satellites, thermal power plants and in defence operation. We can now predict weather and natural calamities and hence take precautionary steps to save human lives.  Computers have successfully forecasted cyclones like Katrina, Praline, Tsunami etc. and timely evacuation was made to save thousands of human lives. Similarly, computers also play vital roles in the military operations; where most of the weapons are controlled by computers and hence helps in safeguarding the country.\n\nIn a nutshell, computers have become a crucial part of our lives. It is rightly said that the world is constantly shrinking and everyone is getting close to each other by use of computers.\n\nIn a nutshell, computers have become crucial part of our lives.

Therefore, life in prison is a better punishment for murderers.", "extra_topic": "", "model_answer": " (Mixed opinion)The issue whether the murderers should be punished with death penalty or not is a controversial one. Many people support the death penalty as a capital punishment and think that this is a vital way to establish peace and law in the world but there are lots of opinions against it. I support the death penalty for murderers if it's really necessary for prevailing peace but if there is any alternative way to give the criminals a chance to remorse and lead a civilised life again, and then they should be given it.\nIn today's society, life is very violent and if we read the newspapers and watch the news on TV, we find lots of murders and other crime news almost daily. There are many mentally ill people who are committing crimes and almost nothing will stop them. These types of psychopathic murders commit murders even sometimes for personal pleasure. We have interviewed captured criminals who say, \"I was going to kill him, but I knew that I could get the death penalty if I did. So I just left him there.\" Obviously, having the death penalty saves lives and that makes a positive difference to society. The death penalty is also useful to send the message to rest of the people that no matter who you are if you commit a murder you are going to be hanged till death or going to sit in an electric chair. This fear is helpful to reduce the homicide in many countries. If a criminal murders someone and then gets the death penalty, that isn't society's fault. Everyone knows about the death penalty as a punishment for murder. So, the person who murders is really killing himself at the same time he is killing his victim. The murderer has made the choice to die. It is important to remember that the death penalty is used only for people who have committed very serious crimes. For example, a woman shot a police officer when she was trying to escape from jail. She was already a convicted criminal when she committed murder, and she deserves the death penalty.\n\nIn many countries, crimes become so severe that the law enforcers can't control the situation and capital punishment becomes a part of the law practice but there are many cases where a man/woman kills another one to protect him or herself. It's not uncommon when a girl kills a rapist to save her dignity and before pronouncing the death penalty the reason must be considered. Even if a single innocent person gets the death penalty that will make the judicial system questionable.    \n\nPeople need to accept responsibility for their actions. Punishing murderers with the death penalty is one way that society can help people to realise the consequences of their decisions.Model Answer 2: (Agreement)\nPunishment is the weapon which society uses to limit and reduce murders\u2019 actions. Punishment type and toughness are different according to the types of crime or action. The most serious crime, which is killing a person with previous planning, leads the murderer to the death penalty after making sure that he/she is the killer through clear proofs. This essay tackles and discusses two contrasting opinions. The first party believes that death penalty is essential and fair enough for killers. Whereas others see that it is fighting badness by badness and that does not generate good and balanced society.\n\nThe first group of people who are pro penalty death have their own logical reasons for their opinion. They say that nothing is equal to life but life itself. So any other form of punishment will not be sufficient or fair. A human body is a unique private property and if somebody causes damage to it or destroys it, he/she must have the same damage. In addition to that making penalty extremely harsh is considered as an effective alarm or red light to whoever may think about committing crimes. Therefore the main aim of penalty will be achieved by reducing crime rates especially killing crimes which have bad results without sufficient compensate.\n\nOn the other hand, there are many people who believe that death penalty is not the best punishment they say that death of criminal or murder will not make the victim return to life. So it is not perfect compensate for victim\u2019s relatives. Although it seems that by killing murder the balance of society will be return, some experts believe that it will raise violence in the society. As a result, they recommend that life in prison sentence is better. That penalty makes killer think always about his crime. It is also lifelong mental punishment when he/she finds other prisons finish their sentences while he/she stash for the rest of his/her life.\n\nFinally, I agree with the first party because of the same reason which I have mentioned previously. Also, that opinion fits my religious belief as Muslim.", "original_link": "https://www.ielts-mentor.com/writing-sample/writing-task-2/267-ielts-writing-task-2-sample-41-by-punishing-murderers-with-the-death-penalty-society-is-also-guilt-of-committing-murder"}, {"essay_topic": "Successful sports professionals can earn a great deal more money than people in other important professions. Some people think this is fully justified while others think it is unfair.", "extra_topic": "", "model_answer": "\nAs a result of constant media attention, sports professionals in my country have become stars and celebrities, and those at the top are paid huge salaries. Just like movie stars, they live extravagant lifestyles with huge houses and cars.\n\nMany people find their rewards unfair, especially when comparing these super salaries with those of top surgeons or research scientists or even leading politicians who have the responsibility of governing the country. However, sports salaries are not determined by considering the contribution to society a person makes, or the level of responsibility he or she holds. Instead, they reflect the public popularity of the sport in general and the level of public support that successful stars can generate. So the notion of \u2018fairness\u2019 is not the issue.\n\n\nThose who feel that sports stars\u2019 salaries are justified might argue that the numbers of professionals with real talent are very few, and the money is recognition of the skills and dedication a person needs to be successful. Competition is constant and a player is tested every time they perform in their relatively short career. The pressure from the media is intense and there is little privacy out of the spotlight. There is a huge number of sports persons compared to those who have become successful and having a huge salary. It takes lots of practice, skills and time to become a sports icon. Again Sports personality like Sachin Tendulkar, Tiger Woods, Shane Warne inspires the new generation to be attracted to the games they play.  So all of these factors may justify the huge earnings of the sports personality.\n\n\nThe first reason why I think that such high salary is deserved by famous athletes and entertainers because we all need them. Entertainment plays an essential role in our everyday's life. We need to relax, watching TV with our favourite TV stars or favourite football players. Entertainment is one of the best ways to eliminate stress and tension and leave all troubles behind. For example, I can not stay home all day long without watching TV. So, basically, I believe that famous athletes and entertainers have such high salaries because we need them. They like doctors for our minds and soles. Scientists say that people usually spend the same amount of money for their food and entertainment. I think this fact tells a lot.\n\n\nThe second reason for this is that famous athletes have to work hard in order to get good results. I am sure that achievements they make are the result of hard work, persistence and pain. They sometimes risk their lives and health. For example, I am a big fan of L. Amstrong, the most famous cyclist in world's history. He faced probably, the most challenging difficulty in his life, cancer. He was very young for this disease. Amstrong was in his early twenties when he found out about it. I read a book about his life, and what impressed me were his words after his victory in France. He said: \"Cancer was the best thing that ever happened to me \". He defeated the disease only because he believed in himself and did not give up. I think such person deserves to have a high salary and be loved by many people throughout the world.\n\n\nPersonally, I think that the amount of money such sports stars make is more justified than the huge earnings of movie stars, but at the same time, it indicates that our society places more value on the sport than on the essential professions and achievements.(Approximately 587 words)", "original_link": "https://www.ielts-mentor.com/writing-sample/writing-task-2/266-ielts-writing-task-2-sample-40-successful-sports-professionals-can-earn-a-great-deal-more-money"}, {"essay_topic": "Nowadays we are producing more and more rubbish.

With the inevitable rise in population and industrialisation, this problem will be further aggravated. The government can help decrease waste production by educating the public and by promoting recycling.\n\nThe global population has reached a staggering seven billion recently. Solid waste is a by-product of this phenomenon. This number is expected to balloon to nine billion by 2050 if the current trend goes on. The amount of trash produced is likewise expected to rise. Manufacturing industries also contribute to the total of accumulated waste. While market demands go higher, the number of factories built also increases to satisfy this demand.\n\n\nThis unsavoury problem has taken centre stage as the world focused on tackling global warming. One way that the government can help alleviate this burden on the environment is by educating the culprits \u2013 the general public. By promoting the use of reusable bags when shopping, the amount of plastic bags can be greatly reduced. Furthermore, the government can also run advertisements and put up posters in ways that a household can reduce the trash it generates. Another step that the government may undertake is through sound recycling. It must invest in a technology that can be managed through the municipal level. To encourage its citizens to adhere to this program, collection areas for recyclable materials must be accessible. Sweden has set these areas within 300 meters from residential areas and so far they are succeeding.\n\n     \nTo conclude, it is a fact that the human population will continue to rise.

Some people argue that having a university in the community has numerous benefits. It helps peoples to save time and cost of transportation to university and provides easy access to state of the art library and computer lab facilities. Despite this, the educational institution within our community could have detrimental effects on people lives. Congestion, traffic problems and increased housing rents are few issues mainly caused by it.\n\nFirstly, local people can save handsome amount and time while having a university in their surroundings, which was earlier utilised for transportation. Secondly, students have freedom of using laboratory and other services longer hours without having a feeling of being too distant from their homes. Thirdly, it also provides business to local peoples as many students come from other nearest cities and need basic amenities such as food, accommodation and others daily use of items.\n\nHowever, a university in our community could have dire consequences on the area it is located.

In addition to this, it is often seen that there is a dramatic rise in rents as a new institute established in any community. We have a university near our community and a new university establishment would create a great debate among the people in our community.\n\nTo sum up I would like to say that university in a communal place is not a pragmatic approach and will increase people woes.

In fact, transportation has become one of the most important parts and parcels of our lives. As the number of population is increasing day by day, so do their demands and needs for modern transportation facilities and that is why the number of vehicles has increased rapidly all over the world. However, for the last few years, air pollution has reached an intolerable level and it is the motorised vehicles that have been creating this acute problem with other factors. Currently, almost 58 million vehicles are running alone on the roads of Britain and day by day this number will increase geometrically. In fact, the problem began with the rapid development and growth of the cities and because of the increasing demand of people and it is badly needed to control it for our own benefits.\n\nIt is true that with the development of the civilisation, the number of cars has increased on the streets and resulting air pollution, accidents, scarcity of fuels, sound pollution, and so on. But we can not avoid or cut off cars from our life overnight because life today has become hasty enough with routine work, office jobs, travelling, holiday activities, amusement etc. and without cars, it would be more troublesome. Therefore I believe that it is important to control the use of cars and to introduce an alternative form of the transportation system as well. Increasing the price of the fuel might be a solution as it will discourage people to drive cars so frequently and for those who are settling their mind to buy a new car. Cars emit Carbon dioxide, Carbon-Mono-Oxide and other harmful chemicals which are dangerous for the environment as well as for public health.\n\nTo reduce the use of cars, we can introduce some alternative transportation systems like the underground railway, city coach service, train service, subtle train etc. If the transports are easily available and comfortable, people will be encouraged to use those to reduce the cost of owning private cars. Some non-motorized vehicles such as bicycles and rickshaws can be the substitute for the motorised vehicles. Once people are aware of the effects of global warming and air pollution, they will definitely use those forms of transportations for their own betterment. Those vehicles are environment-friendly and in some countries, people have already started using bicycles instead of cars, for example, China. If we can introduce river-based cheap and user-friendly transports and try to make them favourite among people, then it will be definitely helpful for the environment. This type of river-based transportation system has been already introduced in countries like Brazil.\n\nOn the other hand, introducing a new law to regulate car ownership is also important. If there were an existing rule that any family cannot buy more than one car, the rapid increase of the car could have been controlled. Besides, the government should introduce a heavy tax on purchasing cars.        \n\nIn summary, increasing use of cars and fuels is an acute problem for all of us. This problem can only be solved by introducing a new form of cheap and comfortable transports and by enforcing and introducing new strict laws.

But it is undeniable that nuclear technology is clean for the environment and offers low-cost energy source. Therefore a lot of people believe that nuclear technology has more positive sides than its negatives. I personally disagree with the statement and the following essay will discuss in details about it.\n\nTo begin with, even though nuclear power could be used as an alternative source of energy, but some parties could misuse the technology. Nuclear power plants can be used as propaganda by some countries, whereas they will tell the public that they only use the technology for power generation purposes. But, the public would never know what lies behind their plants, as they might be developing an advanced and sophisticated nuclear weapons.\n\n\nAnd then, although nuclear power plants are safe to the environment and cheaper in cost, many people still believe that they are a serious threat to the surrounding areas. Some countries have tried to manage their nuclear power plants cautiously, but sometimes unexpected events happen and cause a serious effect on the surrounding areas. For example, it is undeniable that Japan is well known for its advanced, effective and modern nuclear technology. But in the year 2010, a tsunami had struck one of the country\u2019s power plants, and as a consequence, it caused a leakage in the plants and many casualties were found.\n\n\nI believe that that weapon of much destruction is always a threat to the world and it is hard to believe that a weapon can maintain world peace. The history tells us how the weapons have destroyed millions of lives and have caused severe damage to our environment.\n\nIn conclusion, although nuclear technology could be used as a clean and cheap source of energy, I strongly disagree with it. Even though strict monitoring is made sure for those nuclear plant and research centres, some countries might secretly use it as a weapon.

Many people are happy to eat food outside the home and they think that preparing foods is a waste of time but to others outside food is like a toxin and they always avoid outside foods and prepare foods at home. In my opinion, both ways of taking foods have some advantages and disadvantages.\n\nIf someone takes foods from a restaurant or fast food shop, he can save a great deal of time as food preparing is a cumbersome and time-consuming process. For those people there is no monotony of flaming the burner, washing the dishes, preparing the ingredients. They simply order the dishes and everything is ready for them. Moreover, restaurants offer a sound environment with a variety of menus. They don't have to maintain a time schedule to eat and mostly they spend time at a restaurant while they are not busy. Thus they can do lots of work without thinking the cooking issue. Cooking involved going to the grocery and buying vegetable, spices, rice, meat or fishes and it is really a difficult thing to do if someone is very busy with work. Restaurants offer an overwhelming environment to attract the people. They offer music, calm environment and better services.\n\nBut eating in a restaurant is not always pleasant. It costs a great deal of money. Almost all of the dishes cost at least 3-4 times higher than those of home-made foods. Foods cooked in restaurants are not hygienic always and as the restaurant owners want more profit, they don't hesitate to cook low-cost vapid foods. Almost all the items prepared at home are cooked with great care and as it's a matter of our health issue, we choose the fresh and best ingredients while shopping. On the other hand restaurant owners always buy low-quality ingredients. This causes some serious health issues. Those who eat at restaurants are more likely to suffer from different diseases.\n\nAgain, home-made foods are easy to digest and can be taken any time staying at home without thinking  ' what the overall bill are going to be'. Foods prepared at home can save a lot of money and considering the nutrition facts I prefer to prepare and eat foods at home.

Those drugs are very much addicted and the people who take it regularly destroy his life and can not lead a normal life. Likewise, tobacco is another phenomenon that has a strong beckoning towards people of all ages. Considering the bad effects, therefore, it should be considered unlawful and prohibited.There are lots of substances presented in the tobacco and people become much more addictive to the tobacco because it is easily accessible and does not cost that much at a time compared to other illegal drugs. There are enough scientific reasons to believe that once a person becomes addicted towards tobacco, can't leave it easily like other strong drugs. Many people even exhaust more than 20 cigarettes daily and eventually increase the possibility to be infected with lung cancer or many other serious diseases. The person who smokes or takes tobacco in other ways harms himself as well as the people surrounding them. Because it is proven in medical science that second-hand smoking causes the same physical problems as the first-hand smoking does. So considering the issue I strongly opine that all tobacco should be banned like other harmful drugs.\n\nMany people think that tobacco creates some opportunities. For instance, they mention the number of people involved in these industries from farmer to manufacturing workers. They also think that tobacco companies often help people by sponsoring big sports events, initiating some social works like tree-plantation, star search programs etc. In my opinion, all those are eye wash for people. The companies are uplifting their fortunes by destroying innocent peoples' lives. Think about a family that has loose their only earning member because he was a chain smoker for 20 years and recently died of lung cancer. The effects are overwhelming compared to what tobacco companies do for us. I believe there are lots of organisations who are happy to initiate the same social programs for the betterment of people. Science has proven that the amount of nicotine contained in a cigarette is pushed directly into someone's body, he will die at once. So tobacco business is a social crime at large. Furthermore, those who cultivate tobacco, process it prepare cigarette and smokes ultimately become the victims of many serious diseases like cancer, heart diseases and bronchitis. In addition buying tobacco costs money which could have been used for some good thing. Teenagers addicted to tobacco involve themselves to some other drugs and tobacco is always the gateway to other drugs.\n\nI don't think there is any one benefit we get from tobacco rather it harms us in so many ways. There are huge scarcities of food in the world right now and a huge amount of fields and many farmers are engaged in producing tobacco.

Compare the advantages and disadvantages of living in the city to living in the countryside.", "extra_topic": "", "model_answer": "\nThe places where people live affects greatly in their lifestyles and the living place is one of the very basic needs for people. People opine differently while choosing the living places. Some prefer and argue that city is the best place to live at since it provides so many advantages over the rural area, but other think that villages are the best places to live a good life. Both places have advantages and disadvantages.\n\nIt is true that a city offers so many opportunities and advantages those are absent in a countryside. For instance, the modern transportation and communication systems are better in any city compared to a village. In a city people have access to many different transportation systems and have latest technologies to communicate; like cellular phones, internet, fax etc. Moreover, when a new technology arrives at the country it is first introduced in the city area and usually 2/3 years later to the village. Secondly, cities provide better security to its inhabitants like the mobile police patrols, special forces, community police, security guards, traffic police etc. But in the village, the number of security force persons are too low compared to the overall population. Moreover, cities provide better treatment, hospitals, qualified doctors, better educational institutes, and amusement parks etc which are really inevitable to lead a better life. In many cases, those facilities are absent or rare in a village. In my opinion, the reason for why most people tend to live in a city is the vast opportunities of jobs. Most of the corporate offices, industries, factories, government offices, garments and manufacturing industries are either situated in a city or close to the city. People have much more employment opportunities in a city than a village. On the contrary, people living in a village, are often forced to do a job that is not suitable at all for him since the job opportunity is so narrow there. Again, schools or colleges are not equipped with a better environment, labs, teachers and that's why students in a village might not get a better education he/she deserves. If we consider the entertainment facilities in a city then citizens of a city have so many options like theatre, park, art gallery, museum, amusement parks, libraries etc. But people in the villages have only TV or books and very little facilities to spend leisure time.      \n\nOn the other hand, Villages offer many invaluable advantages those are completely absent in the cities. First of all, someone living in a village can get fresh air and water. There is no intense pollution with smoke, Carbon-DI-oxide, Carbon-mono-oxide, Nitrous-Oxide and people living in a village are less prone to suffer diseases like asthma, bronchitis etc. The city can provide security against visible foes but it causes people to face some invisible and dangerous enemies like toxic and polluted air, water and environment. Secondly, people of villages live much nearer to the nature and breathe in the fresh air, as well as eat fresh foods, vegetables, fruits collected directly from the garden. On the contrary vegetables, foods, fruits in the cities are normally stored and mixed with preservatives and can cause serious harms to the health. The living cost in a countryside is much lesser than that of a city. The density of population in a village is much less than a  city and village people are naturally grow up their personal relationship among all people and live like a real community and take care of each other. While in the city people do not know even who live in the next door and personal relationship in a community is rare.\n\nIn my case, I prefer to live in the city. I feel relaxed and comfortable staying in my own city. There are lots of facilities I can't deny are presented in my city and those are the invaluable part of my lifestyle. Moreover, I like to lead a busy and challenging life and want to be connected with the world. I enjoy visiting countryside but get bored there if I stay more than 2/3 days because all of my necessary stuff to lead my as usual life are absent there.(Approximately 694 words)\n(This model answer has been prepared by the site developer.

Although some people believe that one can easily acquire a new language after extensive learning, others claim that age also plays a considerable role in foreign language acquisition. Indeed, it is much easier for children and teenagers to master a new language than it is for adults and especially elderly people.\n\nTo begin with, younger individuals tend to be fast learners due to their developing acquisition skills. Most children and teenagers are used to learning new things, which make mastering a new language as easy as a piece of pie. For instance, toddlers are able to pick up a new language if their parents interact with them using this particular language. However, adults are unlikely to learn a foreign language in the same way.\n\nThen again, adults are too busy at work and have to worry about supporting their family, which certainly distracts them from the process of learning. A good illustration of this case will be evening language courses. Tired after work, adults are not able to make the most of their lessons and thus, cannot learn effectively. Younger people, in their turn, spend a lot of time studying and possess a range of skills to help them improve their foreign language.\n\nUndoubtedly, there are individuals who are so talented that they can learn a new language at any age. However, one has to remember that such people are often a rare exception rather than a common fact.\n\nResearch shows that the brain pattern of a child is in better condition to accept new things that the brain pattern of an average adult. This gives a competitive advantage to the curious young people to learn new things easily than the adults. The trends of quickly learning how to operate a computer by younger people are much more efficient than the learning process of an elderly people and this is true for learning a new language as well.\n\nTo conclude, learning a foreign language is a challenge for most people.

Thus, governmental policies and interference in the agricultural business of the poorer nations were made to secure their dominant source of the economy.

However, the improvements cannot be made by these countries, but more external assistance and aids should be done.\n\nBecause of the shortage of food supply, the people in poorer nations (i.e. Africa) are easily prone to disease, hunger and death. When natural or environmental disasters happen, they are threatening with their lives. Education cannot be well developed as a result of frequent droughts, famines and disease spreading. The other countries, while emphasising on the development of agriculture in the Third World, cannot really give the solution to the cyclical problem which has been existing for a long time. It is time to consider the consequences of all the waste of efforts in trying to help the economic growth of the Third World and to think from the other perspectives.

Some people regard this as completely wrong, while others consider it as valuable work experience, important for learning and taking responsibility.", "extra_topic": "", "model_answer": "\nThe issue of children doing paid work is a complex and sensitive one. It is difficult to say who has the right to judge whether children working is \u2018wrong\u2019 or \u2018valuable\u2019. Opinions will also differ as to \u2018learning\u2019 benefits: no doubt teachers and factory owners, for example, would have varying concerns.\n\nAn important consideration is the kind of work undertaken. Young children doing arduous and repetitive tasks on a factory production line, for example, are less likely to be \u2018learning\u2019 than older children helping in an old people\u2019s home. There are health and safety issues to be considered as well. It is an unfortunate fact that many employers may prefer to use the services of children simply to save money by paying them less than adults and it is this type of exploitation that should be discouraged. There is a big possibility that those working kids are influenced by different types of people they are working with and some lead them to a malevolent way. For example, most of the working kids in the factory start smoking and even abuse drugs at a very early age. Some kids are engaged in full-time jobs to support their family and thus how completely destroying their education.\n\nHowever, in many countries children work because their families need the additional income, no matter how small. This was certainly the case in the past in many industrialised countries, and it is very difficult to judge that it is wrong for children today to contribute to the family income in this way. A working child in many cases is the only earning member for many families. So their support is invaluable and they can\u2019t leave the jobs no matter how hazardous the job is.\n\nNevertheless, I would like to conclude that, in better economic circumstances, few parents would choose to send their children out to full-time paid work. If learning responsibilities and work experience are considered to be important, then children can acquire these by having light, part-time jobs or even doing tasks such as helping their parents around the family home, which are unpaid, but undoubtedly of value in children development.Model Answer 2:\nIn the past few years, life has become really tough for many people and because of the ever increasing living expenses some people send their children to earn to lessen the load.

They may control the number of children someone has through taxes. Is It sometimes necessary and right for a government to control the population in this way?", "extra_topic": "", "model_answer": " (Disagreement)\nOver population is a great concern for many under-developed countries and the government takes many steps to control the uncontrolled increase of population. In many countries, government impose rules to restrict the number of children a family can have and also restricts many facilities in case a family has too many children. But imposing a tax to restrict the number of children in a family is not a feasible solution. In my opinion, other ways of controlling the population in a country should be considered rather than imposing the tax.\n\nFirst of all, the population is the main problem in most of the third world countries whereas the developed countries mostly have control over that issue. In countries like china, the population is not a burden rather they have been able to use the large population as the main workforce for the steady improvement of the country. Overpopulation in an under-developed country directly related to poverty, illiteracy, unhygienic lifestyle and crime. So controlling the population in these countries is a must and imposing a tax on the poor people would not be a good idea. The trends show that educated upper class and middle class do not take more than two children in these countries where the poor people seems like have no control on that. If the government imposes the tax on those poor people, their life would become more miserable.\n\nI completely agree that each government should maintain some policies and should impose strict rules to control the population a country has but increasing awareness and implementing other policies than tax imposing would be better solutions.\n\nIn conclusion, I completely agree that the government of a country should take any initiative to control the over population growth but tax imposing to poor people is the least effective solution since there are many alternatives.Model Answer 2: (Agreement)\nThe population is one of the biggest problems for some of the countries today. The population distribution is every uneven across different countries and while some countries have very less population, some other countries suffer from a large number of population. There are certain countries like India and China which are two highly populated area where as countries like Ireland, Russia and Switzerland are thinly populated. So I agree that the countries that are suffering from the huge population should take steps like imposing a tax on the number of children a family has.\n\nThere are various problems that appear due to the huge population, like poverty, unemployment, crime and illiteracy. Every country has limited resources and if the population rises beyond permissible limit, it results in rapid exhaustion of these resources. Therefore, I agree, sometimes it is necessary for a government to take harsh action to control population. And one of these harsh actions can be limiting the available facility to the persons who have more than an approved number of children and to impose a large amount of taxation due to the large number of children s/he has.  \n\nIndia and China are the world\u2019s most populated countries. During the '70s, the population of both countries\u2019 population was growing at rapid rate and in order to curb its population, china imposed 1-child policy and strictly implemented it. As a result, we can see their population growth rate has reduced drastically to 0.6 % per annum, whereas though India promoted 2-children policy but didn\u2019t enforce any policy. It tried educating people about benefits of small families, give benefits to small families.\n\nThough, there growth rate decreased but wasn\u2019t significant as china. India\u2019s growth rate is still hovering around 1.2% per annum and it is believed that they will surpass China\u2019s population in next decade or so. Problems associated with population are quite evident in India. Healthcare system is abysmal; unemployment, illiteracy, and poverty are rampant.\n\nOn the contrarily, certain European countries have less population and encourage to have more children. Citizens in certain countries are also given extra grants if they have more than two children. The average age of Japan is over 70 years and Japanese government encourages people to have more children in order to have more young population. So countries who have a decent population and are forecasting to decrease the population in the coming ages, should not adopt this taxation strategy.\n\nTo conclude, I think it is of utmost importance that country\u2019s population is proportional to its resources and total area and to strike that perfect balance, sometimes it is mandatory for the government to intervene and impose rules to control the population like taxing the individuals who contribute to increasing the population even more.", "original_link": "https://www.ielts-mentor.com/writing-sample/writing-task-2/255-some-governments-say-how-many-children-a-family-can-have-in-their-country-should-be-strictly-controlled"}, {"essay_topic": "The position of women in society has changed markedly in the last twenty years.

This is, in fact, advantageous for the overall growth a country and at the same time this is one of the main reasons the juvenile delinquency has increased nowadays.\n\nFirst of all, a child needs the tenderness and guidance of parents and if both parents are working they have very little time to spend with the children. The trends of both working parents are leading depression, lack of morality and lose family tie which has severe psychological damage among the teenagers. This is directly leading to issues like crime, drug and immoral activities conducted by the adolescents.   \n\nAgain, this is a long time trend that a father would bring the daily bread for the family while mother would foster and take care of the children in most of the society and with the women empowerment, this harmony has been changed. There is no harm in women employment and in fact this is positive from many perspectives and yet we can see an immense competition among the married couple especially regarding their career while they totally overlook their needs for their children. Fatherhood is important and he has many roles to play for the children but a mother, as we have seen throughout the century, makes the major share of contribution towards upbringing the children. When a mother has very little time to share with her kids, the problem related to juvenile crime increases.\n\nThe teenage time is a very sensitive time in everyone\u2019s life and if parents can\u2019t contribute their duties at that time, the children have a chance to go astray.

Overall, I disagree with the opinion expressed; I would like to begin by pointing out that \u2018traditional skills and ways of life\u2019 are not totally vanished from one country, culture or community because of the introduction of technology.\n\nIn many ways, the history of civilisation is the history of technology: from the discovery of fire to the invention of the wheel to the development of the Internet we have been moving on from previous ways of doing things. Some technologies, such as weapons of mass destruction, are of negative impact. Others, such as medical advances, positively help people to live better or longer, and so very much help traditional ways of life. Surely, few people would seek to preserve such traditions as living in caves. Technology will always follow its own footsteps no matter what we, some people think about it. Technology advances because we need it. So there is no way to prevent the advancement of the technology but we should embrace it positively. The generation of a country is responsible for preserving their own custom and tradition and if people feel eager to save a tradition then there is no way technological advancement will destroy it. There are many cases where technology replaces human labour to create certain things, for example, handmade sari, which is still popular in many countries. Technology, in this case, has not destroyed the old tradition but has introduced a faster and less expensive ways to create the same thing.             \n\nInterestingly, technology can positively contribute to the keeping alive of traditional skills and ways of life. For example, the populations of some islands are too small to have normal schools. Rather than breaking up families by sending children to the mainland, education authorities have been able to use the Internet to deliver schooling online. In addition, the Internet, and modern refrigeration techniques are being used to keep alive the traditional skills of producing salmon; it can now be ordered from, and delivered to, anywhere in the world.\n\nIn conclusion, without suggesting that all technology is necessarily good, I think it is by no means \u2018pointless\u2019, in any way, to try to keep traditions alive with technology.

If you consider that the purpose is to prevent the guilty from being nasty again, you can be seduced by an argumentation in favour of the suppression of capital punishment.\n\nBut you have to think about another aspect of the problem: a punishment is also useful to impress people, to make them fear the law. In fact, let's take the example of a young misfit, which has grown in a violent atmosphere, influenced by older delinquents, etc.  He lives in the streets; he's got no aim but to survive. This is the kind of person who could possibly kill someone for money, or even for fun. Why would he fear prison? Life would be easier for him there. In addition, in many cases, when you behave normally, you can benefit from penalty reductions. This young misfit needs to be impressed; he needs to know that the law is a frontier. When you cross it, you can lose your life. That is why capital punishment helps keep a distance between robbery and murder. If you abolish it, you suppress the difference between these two types of crime, which are completely different.\n\nBut there is also a limit to define: even if the death penalty is unavoidable, it would be a crime to apply it to inadequate cases. If there is no premeditation or past facts which can justify such a punishment, it is far too strict to apply the death penalty.

The idea that women are solely responsible for deciding whether or not to have babies leads on to the idea that they are also responsible for bringing the children up.", "extra_topic": "", "model_answer": "  (Neutral Notion)\nFor nine to ten months, a woman endures the drastic physiological and emotional changes that pregnancy brings about. Because of this, a woman has the greatest right to decide on whether she will have a child or not. An ideology exists that because women take full responsibility for decisions about childbearing, she also is responsible for rearing the child. I believe that this idea is absolutely faulty.\n\nFirstly, decisions on childbearing may be greatly affected by the woman's choice. However, other factors are also considered such as a couple's financial ability to support a child's growth. Aside from that, parenthood is a shared responsibility. A father's role is not limited to sperm donation but also includes changing diapers in the middle of the night. Also, a father should always be involved in child rearing because there are activities that are best suited to be done by a father figure, such as bringing the child to a sports event. Consequently, a child who rarely sees one's father creates a negative perception of him and may possibly create a stronger relationship with the mother alone.\n\nIn addition, women are different in the modern era. More women are breaking the traditional view that they are confined to the four wall of the home as a housewife. Therefore, there should be a joint agreement between both parents to divide the tasks. To cite an example, a mother would send the child to school while a father will be in charge of picking up the child after class.\n\nIn conclusion, I firmly believe that it is time to abolish the idea of putting the entire child rearing work on women. The idea of shared parenthood must be implemented to keep up with the change in family dynamics that occurred over the years.\n\n[Word Count =298 |  Written by - Denise Tubat ]\n\nModel Answer 2:  (Neutral Notion)\nI believe that child-rearing should be the responsibility of both parents and that, whilst the roles within that partnership may be different, they are nevertheless equal in importance. In some societies, it has been made easier over the years for single parents to raise children on their own. However, this does not mean that the traditional family, with both parents providing emotional support and role-models for their children, is not the most satisfactory way of bringing up children.\n\nOf crucial importance, in my opinion, is how we define 'responsible for bringing the children up'. At its simplest, it could mean giving the financial support necessary to provide a home, food and clothes and making sure the child is safe and receives an adequate education. This would be the basic definition.\n\nThere is, however, another possible way of defining that part of the quotation. That would say it is not just a father's responsibility to provide the basics for his children, while his wife involves herself in the everyday activity of bringing them up. Rather, he should share those daily duties, spend as much time as his job allows with his children, play with them, read to them, help directly with their education, participate very fully in their lives and encourage them to share his.\n\nIt is this second, fuller, concept of 'fatherhood' that I am in favour of, although I also realise how difficult it is to achieve sometimes. The economic and employment situation in many countries means that jobs are getting more, not less, stressful, requiring long hours and perhaps long journeys to work as well. Therefore it may remain for many a desirable ideal rather than an achievable reality.Answer 3:", "original_link": "https://www.ielts-mentor.com/writing-sample/writing-task-2/251-fatherhood-ought-to-be-emphasized-as-much-as-motherhood"}, {"essay_topic": "News editors decide what to broadcast on television and what to print in newspapers.

Would it be better if more good news was reported?", "extra_topic": "", "model_answer": "\nIn today\u2019s modern world, a growing amount of news and information on television or newspapers have considerably influenced the public. Besides, what factors are impacted on reporting information on news media is an issue many people feel strongly about. This essay will discuss various influences as well as associated with phenomenon above.\n\nAs far as I am concerned, there is a wide range of factor accounting for publishing news and broadcasts. The most noticeable, I believe, is that aiming at a high audience rating so as to maximise profits. This leads to pursuing the increasingly diverse needs of viewers from all walks of life in order to satisfy and cater to them. Another contributory factor is that for many countries, news editors have to succumb to political pressure, distorting facts and misleading the public. To put it another way, they are controlled entirely by powerful political parties and enjoined to disregard the truth. This is particularly true in many undemocratic countries like Chinese, North Korea, and Vietnam where information is seriously censored and even disseminated political ideals to guide public opinions.\n\nMoreover, living in the information era, people are bombarded with the daily amount of news, including good and bad news, from multiple media. Today\u2019s coverage and press might sometimes be less trustworthy mainly because it often exaggerates the level of the real information, in order to boost the attention of the desired audiences. Furthermore, some media companies use the stories of people\u2019s private life, seductive images and violent or obscene contents to appeal viewers, especially teenagers. It means that their thoughts and behaviours might be changed and shows a tendency to hatred, violence, jealousy, and even copycat phenomenon. However, the role of news media in reporting good news, such as someone\u2019s achievement and human stories, should be acknowledged. That will make quicker progress toward society better.\n\nIn conclusion, what today\u2019s news and information on media we receive is influenced by some main factors as hooking viewers, increasing profits, and obeying political regulations. Besides, the news media can have a double-edged impact on society by the good and bad news. By doing so, we can ensure that choosing information carefully before reading and watching are indispensable to us.\n\n[ by Jack Tran]\n\nModel Answer 2:\nIt has often been said that \"Good news is bad news\" because it does not sell newspapers. A radio station that once decided to present only good news soon found that it had gone out of business for lack of listeners. Bad news, on the other hand, is so common that in order to cope with it, we often simply ignore it. We have become immune to bad news and the newspapers and radio stations are aware of this.\n\nWhile newspapers and TV stations may aim to report world events accurately, be they natural or human disasters, political events or the horrors of war, it is also true that their main objective is to sell newspapers and attract listeners and viewers to their stations. For this reason, TV and radio stations attempt to reflect the flavour of their station by providing news broadcasts tailor-made to suit their listeners' preferences. Program specialising in pop music or TV soap operas focus more on local news, home issues and up-to-date traffic reports. The more serious stations and newspapers like to provide \"so-called\" objective news reports with the editorial comment aimed at analysing the situation.\n\nIf it is true, then, that newspapers and TV stations are tailoring their news to their readers' and viewers' requirements how can they possibly be reporting real world events in an honest and objective light? Many radio and TV stations do; in fact, report items of good news but they no longer call this news. They refer to these as human interest stories and package them in the program specialising, for instance, in consumer affairs or local issues. Good news now comes to us in the form of documentaries the fight against children cancer or AIDS, or the latest developments in the fight to save the planet from environmental pollution.\n\n(Approximately 300 words)\n\n(This model answer has been prepared by the site developer. However, please note that this is just one example out of many possible answers.)\n\nAlternative answer 3:\nNews both in print media and in television should reflect the authentic, unbiased and important news for the audiences and that news play an important role in terms of educating people, informing people about the current world and giving them an insight of political and social view. But sadly this is always not the case and news editors are often broadcast and publish biased and politically influenced news that does more harm than good to the society.\n\nThere are various reasons for that. First of all the personal views and political biasedness are two important factors that cause this problem. Newspapers and TV news should ideally be two great media to reach the people with the real and authentic news. People greatly rely on these media to get updates on events and current affairs and the impartial and biased news misleads them often. Often political views of editors and their link to a particular political party lead to this problem. It is not uncommon that a chief editor gets appointed to the position by the powerful political party and he is expected to present news in favour of this party. Second, in many countries government impose strict rules on what type of news can be presented to the public and that also causes problems in terms of fair and accurate news presenting.   In many cases, money and corruption are involved for such heinous act. Again, many newspapers heavily rely on other renowned newspapers and internet for current news and if the source is corrupted, that leads to the case of printing and broadcasting impartial and misleading news. The personal threat, political reasons, power, greed, pressure and personal gains, business are the main reasons editors sometimes decide what to broadcast and what to print.\n\nI would not agree with the notion that we are used to the bad news as I have witnessed many cases when a good news gets more attention and audience than bad news. It\u2019s true that bad news is by their nature is appealing to people, but as a whole, we want to know about the true happening. Good or bad, people want to learn the truth. Often people\u2019s attention can be achieved by publishing and broadcasting bad and negative news, but this is now always the truth as events like a peace treaty, world up, noble contributions, achievements, good deeds and the political positive decision get more readers and viewers than bad news.\n\nIn conclusion, we are not used to the bad news and editors do decide which news to be reached to the public or not based on their personal, business and political reasons.\n\n(This model answer has been prepared by the site developer. However, please note that this is just one example out of many possible answers.)\n\nModel Answer 4:\nAt the present time, editors decide what kind of news should be shown on television and what kind of news should be printed in newspapers and magazines. It doesn\u2019t matter for them what sort of news, bad or good, their sole wish to make sensation even from bad news. Therefore, there is a lot of bad news which became popular and they have an impact on people. Maybe we have to announce only good news and hide bad ones.\n\nIf we look at today\u2019s world, news sources like newspapers, magazines, television news etc. play very important role in our society. These sources give us information about the world. Firstly it's noticeable that you can see all types of information on TV or newspaper, beginning with the opening of new car factories and culminating with disasters. But you can\u2019t decide what kind of news you want to read on your morning routine, it is decided by the news editors. They will choose which news to publish.\n\nSecondly, editors need your attention so they publish the most interesting news, like Death of Laden or flood in Japan. Thus, people made familiar with that kind of news. In addition, news has the big influence on people, one bad news can affect thousands of people and the same if it would be a good one. To sum up, although some people believe that only good news should be shown or published, in my view, everybody has to know what\u2019s going on in the world and must feel the reality of the life.\n\n[ by - Akmal Sharipov ]\n\nModel Answer 5:\nTopic: News editors decide what to broadcast on television what to print in newspapers. What factors do you think influence this decision? Do we become used to bad news? Would it be better if more good news was reported?\n\nIt is true that the decision of news editor is the final judgment of the news report, which is broadcasted to our media like television and newspaper. This is certainly true that there are a number of factors that always affect to adopt these decisions. However, it can be argued that good news may bring peace and happiness of a nation.\n\nThere are several factors that act as a precursor of the news editor that influence them to take decisions what to broadcast or print to their media. Firstly, perhaps most news editors want to increase the selling of their newspapers in order to rapidly rise up their profit. Secondly, popularity and true news are other significant factors, which influence the news editors to make a decision. Finally, some news editors of developing countries are affected by the political governments to take a decision about their news report.\n\nRecently, we see that many newspapers and televisions channels are publishing bad news. For example, many media, NTV and BTV in particular in Bangladesh, are always broadcasting about the lifestyle of celebrities, which is neither informative nor important. Moreover, this type of news spoils the life of an adult person. If the media provides good news such as educational, scientific and so on, these can motivate the younger to achieve more knowledge. This could result in the immense advantage of a nation.\n\nIn conclusion, while news editors are inspired by the several factors to make a decision about a news report, it can be argued that good news is more indispensable than bad news. Therefore, news editor should broadcast and print such type of news, which can bring many benefits to the human being.\n\n[ by - Jahangir Alam ]\n\nModel Answer 6:\nThe news editors are among the most elite and affluent classes of the present-day society. It is them, who decide what to telecast or publish in mass media like television channels and newspapers. Now, moot questions pertaining to this, focus on sources of shoddy influences on these spokespersons of one\u2019s society? Is the public constantly being tuned to watch controversies or mishappenings around the world? What would it be to experience watching news that is of better quality? Let us discourse on this below.\n\nThe factors that influence news editors are many: the channel management, the politicians and other social magnets of the society, forming the tip of the iceberg. Firstly, the channel CEOs nowadays are behind exclusives that could profit them or generate TRP (Television Rating Point) of the channel. They are least bothered about the value, norms and its impact on public. Secondly, the politicians from a real source of carnage, by pressurising channel editors to censor the news as per their will. This renders the news half boiled or malformed at our dining tables. Finally, the business tycoons of one\u2019s society play an imperative role influencing the mass media with their money power.\nIt is a general concern on mass that the present society is witnessing and is exposed to bad news than the good ones. One major reason behind this charade is that low quality or so-called \"bad news\" are mostly controversial. Media controversy is generally considered to boost viewership. Hence, the channel heads who are predominantly business oriented deliberately flash these bad news, keeping aside the good ones. To cite an example, India recently experienced the news on the demise of Indian president Dr APJ Abdul Kalam, immersed in Indian media against a controversial communal debate that was happening at the same time.\n\nGood news is to be reported on a more frequent basis for the betterment of the society, overcoming the biases and political influences. In this media driven world, channels and newspapers play a vital role in influencing the general public. The recusant impact that these bad news can have on the mushrooming young minds, should be combated.\n\nTo conclude, I would like to opine that news should be graded and treated on its value and social merit, and not TRPs or the evil influences of society.\n\n[ Written by \u2013 Vineeth V. ]\n\nModel Answer 7:\nThis is the news caster's duty whether to broadcast or print any particular news. There are various factors behind these decisions. Although people are seriously disturbed by watching the bad news, I believe that there should be a balance between bad and good news.\n\nThere are numbers of factors from which news editors seemed to be influenced prior to deciding the type of information to be placed as news. Firstly, news corporations are much more obsessed with popularity, competency and profitability amongst their news agencies counterparts. Because, before they are able to earn a stupendous amount of money, they would have to be competitive in the news market. This is the reason why they sometimes tend to show the most drastic, exaggerating and spicy news in order to attract more audiences. Secondly, there are a huge variety of elite industries that are willing to sponsor news agencies .In this way, news editors may have to present the biased, and impartial information solely to promote the attractive reputation of these high-profile industries. Finally, some news firms are perhaps politically, religiously or culturally prejudiced just to make extravagant money.\n\nIt is deniable that bad news does not have any negative impact on people's lives. Most of the time people are being bombarded with the vulnerable news. This has led to a greater level of depression, anxiety, phobia and uncertainty in many people. Also, I tend to believe that news publishers should not be thinking too short-sighted. Rather they should put a greater emphasis on broadcasting the truth and reality as well as maintaining the balance between devastating news and good news. It would be a lot more productive for the nations if they are informed of good news such as improvements in health or scientific matters or any new invention on top of getting the truth about critical global or local matters equally.\n\nIn conclusion, people cannot become immune to the bad news. While there are some crucial factors involved in making news, I would argue that news editors should maintain the balance between both types of news before presenting to the nation.\n\n[ Written by \u2013 Shamaila Afzal ]", "original_link": "https://www.ielts-mentor.com/writing-sample/writing-task-2/250-ielts-writing-task-2-sample-24-news-editors-decide-what-to-broadcast-on-television-and-what-to-print-in-newspapers"}, {"essay_topic": "Some people say that television is a very useful tool when it comes to education.

Some people hold a viewpoint that it can never be educational at all. Others, although, disagree, referring to TV's high potential of teaching through amusement.\n\nAs a matter of fact, television nowadays can hardly be called educational. All those talk shows and soap operas we see every day are a complete waste of time and can even have negative effects by distracting young and undisciplined people from their studies. Moreover, the most of the so-called educational programs in channels like National Geographic channel can not replace books and academic lectures because they tend to entertain people and have not an aim to give deep and concentrated knowledge.\n\nHowever, TV can be a powerful mean of delivering information and a nice part of learning process. Educational Methodists have proved that the more senses are involved at the time of studying; the more effective result can be achieved. Television produces both picture and sound, so its usefulness is obvious. Many teachers already use this advantage actively by showing students video cassettes which go as supplementary material to many language courses. So why not to broadcast such movies through television?\n\nThe problem of the ineffectiveness of television as an educational tool is in fact not a problem of television itself, but of people who decide the content of the particular channel. It is hardly unlikely that content directors would abandon their high profits and change talk shows to lectures and video lessons. Therefore, those, who insist on the uselessness of TV, maybe right, but let us not forget that as technology improves new cheap ways of broadcasting appear, for instance, video broadcasts.

This prover emphasises the women education. Throughout the history men and women both worked together to build a better world and whatever stage the current world is in, that has been contributed both by male and female - surely not by one gender. As university education is so important for the full bloom of one person's merit, skill and knowledge, equal opportunity for both male and female students should be ensured.\n\nTo begin with, if only men go ahead in education, research, arts, history and women stay home, then no good can be done. The history suggests that men are dominant in numbers in science, arts, engineering, creativity and business sectors. But we cannot deny the contribution of Mother Teresa and Madam Merry Currie who have devoted their whole life to the betterment of the world. It is true that if the competition is arranged regardless of gender, more male students will be ahead of women. But still, universities should accept an equal number of students. If fewer females hold the important sectors of a country, naturally women will feel deprived and this will lead them to compete with men.\n\nIt is a mother who is much more emotionally attached to their children and friendlier to children than fathers. So they help the children in their study. So the importance of female education in the higher level should get a priority considering this single issue.\n\nIn conclusion, universities should accept the same number of students from both sexes and give an equal opportunity at every level.(This model answer has been prepared by the site developer.

But special gifts are kind of gifts that he would remember for a long time or even in some cases forever. There are various reasons why we remember those short of special gifts and the most influential reasons are physiological, economic, memory and effort related to the gifts.\n\nFirst of all, a gift, no matter what it is, is always special when it is given by a very dear person. Gift received from parents or children on special occasions are cherished by most of us. In this case, the cordiality and attachment it more important that the gift itself. For instance, many people treasure the gift they receive from a lover, friend, father, mother or a special person for a long time. The gift I got from my father on my 12th birthday was merely a diary and that I still consider a very special gift for me. This special gift reminds me my childhood and the love of my father and that\u2019s why I will always remember it.\n\n\nSecond, people often wish for certain things which are they usually can\u2019t buy and if such a present is given someone, it is likely that he will remember it for a long. For instance, when my uncle purchased me a laptop when I was around 18 years old, I was very excited and I will never forget the gift. Sometimes the surprise gifts are memorable and become special to some persons. For instance, the gift I gave to my college on his birthday became one of the special gifts for him as he later expressed. Thus these sorts of special gifts remind us the goodwill and love we actually receive from that person.\n\nThird, expensive gifts often surprise people and can become their special gift. If a car is bought to someone which he would not be able to afford is ought to become a special gift as well. It is common human phycology that they would remember such gifts for a long.\n\nFinally, the memory related to a gift is the most important factor for a special gift. The small gift given by a father who is no more with the children would definitely become a valuable gift to that son/daughter. With time the gift might get lost or broken or even useless but the memory remains and thus the memory involved with a gift is an important factor and that\u2019s why people would remember the gift.(This model answer has been prepared by the site developer.

In my opinion, the government actually should reserve a percentage of such jobs to maintain the equal opportunity, to maintain a balanced workspace and in the overall economy.\n\nFirst of all, the high-level jobs occupied by the male diminish the balances of power between the male and female in such organisations.

An increasing number of countries now have nuclear weapons or have the technology required to make such bombs, and there is an ongoing debate about how to control the threat of nuclear weapons. After the fall of Russia, many Russian scientists have found their nuclear technology expertise is in high demand in countries that have an ambition with nuclear technology. Many believe that, at that time, technology has been secretly made available to many aspiring countries such as Iraq, North Korea, India, Pakistan and others. Experts believe that nowadays, many confrontational countries and terrorist organisations have nuclear power and they  know how they could use this power for terrorism and mass destruction. However, it would have been better if it had never been used to create nuclear weapons. If life on earth is to continue, we must control nuclear weapons of mass destruction. To eliminate the threat of nuclear war, all the nuclear power nations of the world should agree to disarm as soon as possible.\n\nNuclear power stations provide an important source of cheap power in many industrialised nations and some developing countries. However, like most sophisticated technology, there are dangers associated with it. Even though very high safety precautions are taken, there have been few cases of disasters; two or three were major human disasters. Yet many experts believe that in the coming days, nuclear power will be the most efficient source of energy for the mankind.\n\nNuclear technology has been widely used in medical science. X-rays are widely used technology that medical diagnosis. Radiotherapy is widely used to help cure some diseases such as cancer. Controlled and measured radiation is applied on malignant cancerous cells to kill them or stop their spreading.\n\nIn conclusion, nuclear technology certainly has many positive uses and offers lots of promise. But we have to bear in mind that it is dangerous if not handled properly or goes to the wrong hands. Nuclear technology should be only used for the true benefit of the mankind. If we forget this, we have to take the responsibility of our own destiny.", "original_link": "https://www.ielts-mentor.com/writing-sample/writing-task-2/195-ielts-writing-task-2-sample-11-nuclear-technology-should-be-used-for-constructive-purposes"}, {"essay_topic": "Nowadays, more and more foreign students are going to English-Speaking countries to learn the \u201cinternational language \u2013 English\".

I agree that this is a good way, yet students can learn English in other useful ways and those can be even better than the first approach.\n\nBeing in an English speaking country helps students learn English in many ways. Firstly, the surroundings and environment influence our learning. We are forced to speak, read write, and slowly we start even thinking in English since we have to. Secondly, quick learning of the language can become a strong motivation because, in turn, we will get quick feedback that lets us find what we learn really benefits us in life and education. This inspires us to continue to learn more. It\u2019s a positive reinforcement Learning builds on progressively. The initial learning serves as the basis for further learning. Thirdly, in an English-speaking country, you will be learning from the life and culture which is not present off that land.\n\nHowever, in this age of cross-culture communication and Internet, learning English in an English-speaking country is not the only way. The English language learning opportunities are available in many countries. Nowadays people are able to find various ways of learning the English language in their home country that are highly effective and productive. Watching English movies, television, listening to English music and browsing Internet can open up a vast plethora of English materials. For instance, one can make use of the vast storage of materials (video, sound, graphics, etc.) on the Internet to facilitate language study. Sometimes non-English speaking students may need a different approach for learning English. The principle of \u201cdifferent students, different teaching\u201d, by the famous saying by Chinese guru Confucius, maintains that different teaching approaches are useful for different segments of students. The way a foreign student learns a language is quite different from those of an English native speaker. For example, a foreign student higher level; however, it is unnecessary for a native speaker. Last but not the least, on some occasions, students may find teachers in their own countries do a better job in figuring out their exact weak points and the remedies for them. A teacher of a non-English country understand the basic of a student and can combine both the native language and English to make the study plan and this might be more helpful than a native English teacher's approach of studying.   \n\nIn conclusion, I believe studying English in English-speaking country is a good way but in many cases, the other ways can be proven to be more efficient than being in an English speaking country.

Some governments have even banned smoking in all public places. This is a good idea but it takes away some of our freedom.", "extra_topic": "", "model_answer": "\n(Agreement: Smoking should be banned in office premises and public places)\nThere is no scope of argument that cigarette smoking is harmful both for the smoker and people around him/her. Cigarette smoking has two major effects on non-smokers-injurious passive smoking and smoking display that has an invitational or persuasive effect on non-smokers. I believe banning smoking in public places and offices not only will discourage smoking but will also keep the smoking practice out of site, though it might apparently look like transgress into smoker\u2019s freedom. But I believe any harmful activity of a particular person or group of people can not be a definition of freedom. If smoking right in any place is a definition of freedom then why not other drugs? In m opinion, every public place including office must be smoking free.     \n\nThere are several reasons that government and private authorities are being strict on smoking in offices and even public places. Firstly, this is an accepted fact that smoking is injurious and deadly to health in several ways. Secondly, smoking causes health hazards to non-smokers who inhale smoke passively from the smokers. Thirdly, smoking has a strong psychologically influence on others, particularly on children and young who learns from their elderly. Fourthly, in many countries, the cost of health care and insurance has gone up due to smoking related illnesses. So health authorities and governments are trying to have been seen that due to the restrictions, the habit of smoking is on a decline among office goers.\n\nThough non-smokers think that restricting smoking in offices and public places is a good idea, smokers often view it as an intervention into their right. Smokers argue that cigarette smoking has a direct relation to their workplace performance, though passive smoking can cause objections from colleagues. But considering the harm of smoking it should be banned.\n\nThough pressure groups such as tobacco companies may discourage restrictions on smoking, since the advantages of ban outweigh the disadvantages, mass public support such bans. Moreover, offices have the right to regulate staff behaviour and activities and governments too can ban smoking in public places for a greater societal benefit.\n\nIn conclusion, restricting smoking in workplaces and in public is a good idea. I can also understand the opinion of smokers that banning smoking in such places limits their work speed but I believe with little practice and determination they can overcome it. So I strongly support the idea of prohibiting smoking in any public place including the office premises.  Model Answer 3:\nUse of tobacco products has become popular after the industrial revolution. Cigarettes are so cheaply available that people do not bother to think about it before lighting one in every minute. Society is engaged in very long debate, whether smoking should be banned completely in public places or not. Some argue that it would encroachment to one's freedom, while others support this idea. I think smokers should be allowed to smoke only in designated areas away from the public.\n\nAccording to world health organisation, smoking is biggest cause of oral and lung cancer. Even second-hand smokers, people who inhale smoke releases by smokers, are equally prone to the disease. Therefore, looking at this risk, smokers and non-smokers should be segregated. In countries like the United States of America, designated smoking areas are built and smoking in public places is banned and fines are imposed if anyone is found using cigarettes in public place.\n\nWhile it may be easy to argue that banning smoking is intruding to one's freedom. But forcing one's smoke to other non-smokers is even a bigger crime. Advocates, who fight for the ban of smoking, ask that why should an innocent bystander suffer from the smoke released by smokers? Therefore, it can easily be concluded that banning smoking is public place is not attached to freedom; it is rather imposing the right of freedom.\n \nWith above points, in conclusion, it can be concluded that with alternative options for smoking location made available, smoking can be banned at all public location without creating any controversy.", "original_link": "https://www.ielts-mentor.com/writing-sample/writing-task-2/193-ielts-writing-task-2-sample-9-many-office-authorities-impose-restriction-on-smoking-within-the-offices-premises"}, {"essay_topic": "Safety standards are important when building people's homes. Who should be responsible for enforcing strict building codes \u2013 the government or the people who build the homes?", "extra_topic": "", "model_answer": "Model Answer 2:\n(Viewpoint: Government should be responsible for enforcing strict building codes)People or commercial constructors build homes for private dwelling or for commercial uses and the number is increasing rapidly as the demand for new buildings is increasing. In all cases of building a new construction safety of dwelling is important. It is home maker\u2019s or contractors responsibility to build houses complying with standard engineering requirements and building codes set by the respective governments. I believe that the government should always be there to strictly enforce building codes, and in the case of non-compliance authorities should take punitive measures. Enforcement of the law is government\u2019s responsibility. Since non-compliance can not only cause hazards to the homeowners, but also to tenants and if in a cooperative or apartment, many co-owners may suffer.\n\nThe building codes are regulatory requirements concerning safety and quality of the construction, use of space and others. For example, in an earthquake-prone area, the buildings should not be very high and the design and structure must have higher earthquake resistance. Big houses and long buildings (i.e. academic departments, hotels and hostels) require dilatation every 15-20 meters so that in a heavy earthquake, only part of a building collapses, not the whole. Moreover, the quality of the materials used in construction and electric wiring, and the gas connection should pass minimum safety standards. Adequate entry & exit facilities and emergency exist, fire extinguishers are also very important is establishments like factories, hall rooms, discos, party centres.\n\nIn cases of a wooden house, wood must be coated with fire-resistant paint. In large apartments, office buildings, hall rooms and lobbies of hotels, fire-barriers made of rubber and steel are used to prevent the spreading of fire. Similarly, in areas of frequent hailstorms, skylights must not be used, and if so, must be protected by steel shutters.\n\nMany constructors often tend to ignore the minimum safety requirements to minimise costs which jeopardise people\u2019s life. Many private homemakers do not know details of these standards and precautions. It is the responsibility of the government to disseminate such essential knowledge and monitor the compliance of builders, developers and makers of houses. However, the builders cannot avoid their responsibility anyway.\n\nIn conclusion, in this modern world, the government is ultimately responsible for its entire citizen\u2019s safety and good life. It is also the government's responsibility to enforce strict building code. If the negligence of any government agency jeopardises people\u2019s life, the government will be held responsible.", "original_link": "https://www.ielts-mentor.com/writing-sample/writing-task-2/192-ielts-writing-task-2-sample-8-safety-standards-are-important-when-building-people-s-homes"}, {"essay_topic": "To solve the ever-increasing environmental hazards throughout the world, the best way is to increase the price of fuel.", "extra_topic": "", "model_answer": " (Disagreement)\nIt is true that skyrocketing the fuel price can make a nosedive on the use of vehicles in many cities but curtailing the volume of energy we utilise is not an elixir as it would soar the daily living expense as well. Hence, the human being ought to scout out renewable energy in an attempt to halt the tide of environment upheaval.To begin with, protecting the environment only through the buoyant price of energy sounds somewhat over-optimistic. Developing other environment-friendly forms of momentum, such as hydrogen, which is the most potent weapon to deal with this murky water is a far better solution. Despite the exorbitant price of fossil fuel, there is still a kaleidoscope of transportation that will need it. And by extension, airplane would be a concrete example- although the usage of these kinds of gigantic transportations is bound to dwindle, it is undeniable that they still emit a sheer amount of carbon dioxide. Therefore, diving deeply into the domain of substitute energy can be served as a luminary that close Pandora\u2019s Box.\n\nBesides the renewable energy and the colossal fuel price, rearing a myriad of flora can usher in a great preponderance.

So, for peace to prevail, female leadership can be considered as a better option than male leadership.", "extra_topic": "", "model_answer": "\n\n\n(Disagreement: Denied the fact that violence and conflict were less under female leadership)The human history has been violence and conflict-stricken since the beginning of the human existence. If we look back in history or to the world around us, we see wars, conflict, power struggles and revolutions, peace making kings, prudent emperors and ruthless rulers. History also reveals that society has always been predominantly male dominated, with leaders and rulers mainly being men. It is, hence, easy to blame the ruler and put the responsibility of atrocities on the shoulders of men. But a deeper perspective always reveals to historians that conflict is a generic tendency of humans. So peace being disturbed is not the liability of men only, but humans in general, and a power shift, from men to women, is destined to be futile in prevailing peace.\n\nMost of the women who are known to be great till date, e.g. Queen Isabella of Spain, Queen Mary, a.k.a. Bloody Mary, Victoria, and Elizabeth of Britain, all have ruled over a vast spectrum of power. And they often have done so ruthlessly, achieving goals with an iron hand. They have waged wars that are barely comparable to only a few of those devised by men. These women are not anomalies of history, but examples from numerous others, who went beyond the boundaries of gender in the path of prevailing in power while expanding peace whenever they deemed it to be expandable.\n\n\nThe two greatest wars of modern history, World Wars I & II, have taught us that wars are impersonal. Race, religion, nationality, sex are only pretences to the universally human lust for power. It is true that during both the global conflicts men were in the rulers\u2019 thrones. But it will be foolish to say that Margaret Thatcher, the famed Iron Lady who spared no road against a minnow enemy in the war of Falkland, would be more peacefully diplomatic than how the greats Winston Churchill and Franklyn D. Roosevelt had been tackling the Axis of Hitler.\n\n\nThe gender issue is only a determinant in the battle of the sexes, not the battles among nations and peoples. It is therefore, impertinent, if not irrational, to conclude that world conflicts result from the rule of a particular gender and the finer sex would do a better job at prevailing peace if selectively put at the helm of human nations.", "original_link": "https://www.ielts-mentor.com/writing-sample/writing-task-2/189-ielts-writing-task-2-sample-5-violence-and-conflict-were-more-evident-under-male-leadership-than-under-female-leadership"}, {"essay_topic": "Parents are the best teachers.", "extra_topic": "Idea Generation for this IELTS Essay:", "model_answer": "\n(Agreement: Parents are the best teachers)\u2018Whether parents are our best teachers or not\u2019 is a never-ending debate and people are divided both in favour and against this argument. Both have a very strong contribution and influence on a child\u2019s learning but in my opinion, parents overtake the teachers in terms of teaching their children.\n\nFirst of all, I would like to point out that a teacher is not merely a person who takes a text book and read texts from there to a student. Rather a teacher is someone who devotes his/her times to teach someone everything that someone needs to know to advance to next step. Morality, intricacies of life, subject matter knowledge, art, science, history, value of time etc. are something that can\u2019t be taught through academic books and a good teacher is someone who teaches someone these all.\n\nNow that we know the true responsibility of a teacher, we can easily compare our parents and teachers. The things that we learn from our parents are far more important than what we learn from our teachers. I am not denying the invaluable knowledge we learn from our teachers through our academic years, but what we learn from our parents are incomparable. We learn to survive, talk, and distinguish well from bad, values of life, morality and such important other things from our parents. We are the true reflection of our parents and our characters are shaped by their personality and behaviours.

Think of a student who is unable to pay his/her monthly school fees would be cast away from the school and the beloved teachers would scarcely be there to help him/her. On the other hand, the parents would always be there with their every possible effort to help the child.\n\nIn summary, the things we learn from our teachers are important for our lives and with those valuable lessons and knowledge we prepare for the future but the things we learn from our parents shapes who we are, who we become and their contribution is much more important compared to the contribution of the traditional academic teachers and that\u2019s why in my opinion parents are best teachers.", "original_link": "https://www.ielts-mentor.com/writing-sample/writing-task-2/188-ielts-writing-task-2-sample-4-parents-are-the-best-teachers"}, {"essay_topic": "Many people believe that women make better parents than men and that is why they have the greater role in raising children in most societies.

The way a father or mother treats a child affects greatly for his/her future growth both mentally and physically. If parents fail to take great care of their children, then those children might go astray and will claim their parents for their misfortune. Every mother and father love his or her children more than anything in this world and they expect them to be great persons and well established in future. Throughout the human history, mothers mainly take care of the children and do most of the works for the children. On the contrary, men are mainly busy outside the home to earn the living for the whole family.\n\nThis is not to say that men are not of importance in children caring and they do not know their kids. They are most necessary if children are to appreciate fully the roles of both sexes. But women have proven themselves superior parents as a result of their condition, their less aggressive natures and they are generally better to communicate with kids. Men remain busy at their works and have to stay outside the home most of the time, but women have lots of spare times to share with their children. From the time they are little girls, females learn about nurturing. First with dolls and later perhaps with younger brothers and sisters; girls are given the role of career. Girls see their mothers in the same roles and so it is natural that they identify this as a female activity. Boys, in contrast, learn competitive roles far removed from what it means to nurture. While boys may dream of adventures, girls' conditioning means they tend to see the future in terms of raising families. Girls also appear to be less aggressive than boys. In adulthood, it is men, not women, who prove to be the aggressors in crime and in war. Obviously, in raising children, a more patient, gentle manner is preferable than a more aggressive one. Although there certainly exists gentlemen and aggressive women, by and large, females are less likely to resort to violence in attempting to solve problems.\n \nBut if we consider that all women are good for their children and men can not raise a kid properly then perhaps it would be a partial judgment. Is not there any family where the mother has died or not present and it is the father who takes care of the children as well as does jobs outside? Certainly, there are lots.
